<p>From my vantage, Product Management is a misunderstood social discipline requiring us to appreciate the interpersonal skills necessary to cultivate relationships and actively listen to Stakeholders and Customers with empathy in the interestest of learning from them. Additionally, our market knowledge will grow, allowing us to discuss those apparent opportunities with our Design and Engineering colleagues for further investigation.</p>
<p>Some conversations will be challenging, and Product Managers must keep their <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/theevabea/status/1605252972753129472" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">biases</a> in check to ensure we hear the opinions of our Customers and Stakeholders. Otherwise, our thinking has built-in prejudices that will stop us from learning about their situation. Articles such as <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/theevabea/status/1605252972753129472" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Leading without being the Boss by Roman Pichler</a> are helpful because they reinforce how attentiveness, curiosity, openness, and integrity make for effective <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servant_leadership" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">servant leadership</a>.</p>
<p>With that said, it will be challenging. Company leadership or the Sales team will push us to "Build first, ask questions later" as your remuneration might depend upon a particular improvement. However, in a Product-led organisation, everyone should lean in and share their point of view to benefit the customers. That requires all parties to collaborate, avoid conflict, to achieve alignment that serves the customer whilst remaining focused on our shared <a href="https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/mission-vision-strategy-goals-roadmap" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Mission, Vision and Strategy</a>.</p>
<p>Increasingly, I view Sales and Customer Success as an extension to the core Product team—an intelligence network allowing us to draw on the broadest insight as they're speaking to customers more regularly than anyone from the core Product team. As a result, you're more likely to be aware of changes in the market sooner, and various unmet customer needs they're confident we can fulfil. But, as Gabrielle says below, it's our job, Product Managers, to work with Sales.</p>

<p>If we're all working in concert, we can get under the skin of the problems that matter. We can then move forward and explore how we'll solve them. That requires a two-way conversation with both disciplines sharing crucial information to develop a shared understanding and begin the journey to a <a href="https://www.pendo.io/product-led/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Product-led organisation</a>. Additionally, it will need collaboration with the customer to support further problem discovery and confirmation. It is challenging, but we need to cut through this cacophony of noise to extract the necessary information to solve the problems that resonate with our users. The objective must be to create a delightful experience that triggers habitual usage by our users.</p>
<p>Lastly, if we identify what's truly important to our customers, we'll see the results in our data. So we're looking to build new capabilities that create an ethical mental trigger that results in the user returning to our product once we've had that 'Aha' moment—for example, checking their daily sales revenue via several online stores and the quantity attributed to advertising, promotions and subscriptions. We should then be able to monitor feature adoption via product dashboards highlighting Weekly Active Users, Monthly Active Users and changes to Annual Recurring Revenue. If you want to learn more, I highly recommend reading <a href="https://amzn.to/3YIql7J" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Hooked by Nir Eyal</a> to explore how you may build habit-forming products.</p>
<p>I hope the above was insightful and that you'll consider leaning in further to share your perspective with a Product Manager in your company over a cup of coffee.</p>
