Ignite not only underpins our Managed Service business but is used by SaaS customers who wish to retain the software after In-Housing or have licensed it directly.</p>\n<p>Ignite is an omnichannel analytics platform that consolidates eCommerce data from Amazon, Shopify and WooCommerce along with advertising data from Amazon, Facebook and Google. The goal of the product is to provide operational improvements for our customers by consolidating performance data into a suite of unified dashboards with actionable insights to drive further success. To do so we utilise AWS Lambda, S3, Athena, SQS and SageMaker, the Snowflake cloud data warehouse and Angular web framework.</p>\n<p>Over the last two years I’ve mapped out our Product Vision, identify key product Personas for our customer groups, contributed to the tiering of functionality for our pricing strategy and defined our product management processes.

This vision required us to reinvent our data collection and reporting capabilities to meet these needs. I became the Product Owner for the newly formed Vendor Integration Engine team. The team and I built the functionality necessary to meet the data collection requirements and scale to support a worldwide media agency group. I collaborated with external providers to create custom data feeds or utilised public APIs to retrieve the desired datasets. Once the integrations became possible, we refined the details as “three-amigos” before formally kicking off the development. We built a scaled platform that collected data from thousands of data sources to support hundreds of customers globally.</p>\n<p>Pre-acquisition, I worked in the same capacity but regularly moved between initiatives to enhance data management and industrialise error-prone manual activities.
