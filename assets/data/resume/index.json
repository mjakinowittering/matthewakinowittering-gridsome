This vision required us to reinvent our data collection and reporting capabilities to meet these needs. I became the Product Owner for the newly formed Vendor Integration Engine team. The team and I built the functionality necessary to meet the data collection requirements and scale to support a worldwide media agency group. I collaborated with external providers to create custom data feeds or utilised public APIs to retrieve the desired datasets. Once the integrations became possible, we refined the details as “three-amigos” before formally kicking off the development. We built a scaled platform that collected data from thousands of data sources to support hundreds of customers globally.</p>\n<p>Pre-acquisition, I worked in the same capacity but regularly moved between initiatives to enhance data management and industrialise error-prone manual activities.
