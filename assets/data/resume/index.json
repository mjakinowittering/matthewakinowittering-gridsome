The team and I built out the functionality necessary to meet the data collection requirements and scale to support a worldwide media agency group. I collaborated with external providers to create custom data feeds or utilised public APIs to retrieve the desired datasets. Once the requirements became clearer, we’d discuss the detail as “the three-amigos” before formally kicking off the development.
