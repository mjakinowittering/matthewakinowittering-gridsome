Even with the ups and downs it invariably brings, it's a perfect fit for my interests. Like many, I enjoy taking on customer problems we've discovered and pursuing that valuable solution. However, this behaviour is far from my initial product management experience specifying the desired functionality in product requirements documents, handing over the work to an engineering team, and reviewing the output. At this point, I hadn't yet understood the value of storytelling.</p>\n<p>Luckily, this wasn't my experience for long. Within a year or two at Ask.com, I went through a company transformation workshop led by <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/cagan/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Marty Cagan</a>. Then, I saw the proverbial light and read <a href=\"https://svpg.com/inspired-how-to-create-products-customers-love/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Inspired</a> from cover to cover. The experience instilled in me that an empowered multi-discipline product development team with co-located members will outperform others when they can articulate the vision, customer problems and desired outcomes.</p>\n<p>Fast forward a few years, I continually found myself stuck on how best to onboard, share and retain knowledge as team members rotated. When well organised, the structure of Sprints and the temporary nature of User Stories don't have a negative impact. We were well-versed in decomposing the problem, enhancing the product, and shipping frequently. We even established a pattern of release twice a week. Problems only arose when we failed to refer to something we'd learnt three or more months ago, which had since become assumed knowledge. As our work covered bulk data collection and ingestion, the typical answer to this problem was creating yet another page on the wiki to retain requirements in technical documentation for troubleshooting at a later time. Unfortunately, this documentation was only an artefact to help capture the development requirements for engineers and quality assurance. It said nothing about the customer or the intended purpose of the dataset. At the time, I felt this was a massive gap in my \"product toolkit\" and the team's knowledge.</p>\n<p>As I see it, one of the many benefits of the web and especially social networks is the serendipity of learning something helpful but unexpected. A personal example of this was coming across Karthik Raman's article, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-i-started-writing-product-narratives-karthik-raman/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Why I started writing Product Narratives in 2017</a>. Karthik recommends structuring your narratives in prose to describe the end-to-end experience of my product in a very conversational tone.</p>\n<p>I adopted this idea and even used the concept to construct a brief narrative for each User Story. By doing so, I've found that I can better outline the context of the problem and the desired outcome. From my experience, I've found that writing Product Narratives has helped me focus my mind and identify the core ideas worth solving and shelve those for reexamination later. As I work through this process, I collaborate with others and seek feedback for peers and the product development team.</p>\n<p>We use these narratives as the North Star to keep us honest while building out a significant change to the product. Then, when the product needs to go through a substantial change cycle, I start another narrative referencing the former to provide the background information and begin describing desired changes seen by our user. Working in this manner has made it easier to retain the big picture without writing gruelling specifications that colleagues seldom read in their totality.</p>\n<p>I've carried on like this quite happy for several years working in this fashion. It's been an excellent vehicle for writing up high-level requirements in an accessible format before working through the details with UX Designers and Engineers. However, I sometimes find myself pitching projects to our founders in light of reoccurring feedback from customers. While these aren't entire pivots and fit our product strategy, they take our roadmap in an unexpected direction. I'm increasingly finding that I struggle to communicate these unwelcome projects upwards. After a bit of reflection, I realised that my storytelling wasn't hitting the mark for this audience.</p>\n<p>Enter Harriet Patience-Davies. Harriet did a fascinating talk at the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/yZN6IYciwU8?start=859&#x26;end=1452\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Driving a shared product vision and goal setting ProductTank in November 2021</a>. Her presentation on storytelling introduced me to the logline concept. In Hollywood, loglines help sell a movie within a succinate sentence giving the reader a high-level summary. For example.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>   When &#x3C;flawed hero at start of the story> is forced to &#x3C;call to adventure> he/she has to &#x3C;achieve or overcome something> or risk &#x3C;losing everything>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, we could adjust this structure to read as follows for a product development team.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>   A &#x3C;company/team/product> must/needs to/wants to &#x3C;take action> to &#x3C;fix a problem/win new audience/reach objectives> or risk &#x3C;the stakes>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So why is this important? In my humble opinion-the trickiest bit about being a Product Manager is bringing everyone along with you. But as you find yourself talking to the different roles inside and outside your business. It will also be necessary to communicate accordingly at various stages. I believe the product narrative is a brilliant vehicle to communicate the ambition and relevant detail to product team members, who can then build upon this information to figure out the UI/UX and deliver working software that solves the problem definition. However, the logline format allows Product Managers to encapsulate the problem and desired conclusion in a pithy statement to capture the audience's attention. However, the people outside the product development team stand to gain the most from a logline format as you sell your team's solution to their problem.</p>\n"}},{"node":{"path":"/blog/acorn-i-are-finalist-for-amazon-ads-partner-awards-2021/","title":"Acorn-i are finalist for Amazon Ads Partner Awards 2021","subtype":"post","authors":["Matthew Akino-Wittering"],"figure":{"caption":"Unsplash","img":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/2021-12-14-amazon-ads-partner-awards-finalists.0b85c65.dc76bf61f9c1da40800e76fa9f432601.jpg","size":{"width":1920,"height":1080},"sizes":"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px","srcset":["/assets/static/2021-12-14-amazon-ads-partner-awards-finalists.1b91758.dc76bf61f9c1da40800e76fa9f432601.jpg 480w","/assets/static/2021-12-14-amazon-ads-partner-awards-finalists.3df3210.dc76bf61f9c1da40800e76fa9f432601.jpg 1024w","/assets/static/2021-12-14-amazon-ads-partner-awards-finalists.0b85c65.dc76bf61f9c1da40800e76fa9f432601.jpg 1920w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1920 1080' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-31bd800c3abd53c4730fceaeb953665b'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='40'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-31bd800c3abd53c4730fceaeb953665b)' width='1920' height='1080' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%2c/9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAkAEADASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGwAAAgMBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAABQYABAcDAQL/xAAxEAACAQMDAgMGBQUAAAAAAAABAgMABBEFEiETQSIxYQYHUXGBkRQXMlLRJDRjg8H/xAAZAQADAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACAwQBBQD/xAAjEQABBAEDBAMAAAAAAAAAAAABAAIDEQQSMTIUIUFxQlGB/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwB9s/ezZOoxpVyP9y/xRP8AM/T2RTHYXRc%2bYLqAPrWGWOm3SRDp3ETHtuUg1db8VZW4mm6TIO6vnPOOPrQiSIdluiQ96W5WfvD0%2bY4mtLqL1G1/4ozbe1ejz8C6MZ/yIVrANLvn3Eudw8zz5UYj1QLIoAyvxFAZm%2bFQ2G91vdvfWlz/AG9zDJ6K4NWKwqLWJUZWQqqg9xmma19qzsCLuyAAAvepn5hZ8bTuj1cStPrwmsb1T2rKzMDJNC44LBiDQ1feDqVuJGg1B5FUYKzAOB9%2baOLKEg2r9S5MYs8pPsboCJW5DLj9TeY9P5ojayRS26rPEpG7jAwMfLtSdpt6cJ4QrN4gP3fSnXQrYTbs8A4JHmMf85qJ%2bhlucmRxyPIaEQs7aHpZhtUUBvDsy25e2Se/yq/FbWpTa0EeQScY%2bNFtPQRwAA4KDxDHb4/alrWr0R3TNCTtHmVH3qaAh4oWq3tMZsoj04EBaKOFZCpVSRkA9jiuV6TLZLF1lScDa0ka4ye/lQZNSZwpz5dz2z3NfLXuCxaPa/7hjLfKifiB7w47pfUFooK/d3NogtYbhfxM8g6eQB4cDO5qF3rEKDEyCBYQOgYVHjJzuz6CqU17/Uk9VHym058xz2HpgVwvJ90eFfM%2bTgE47d/WgbgsFfVoTkOOyV9JjU6hE%2bPEFznPpT7pMzWt0OljDDBU8ipUo87gfStwfHtMt7OywIAB4mpW1uQpEzIArAjkZqVKVgcAhzeaBC4lS4MSt4S3P0FdFnkZnDNnAYD04qVK6ZC5L90KuZGR0ZcZEYYZ5weaDXdzK0LNvIOG/Tx2qVK2u4Xo9iv/2Q==' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"},"alt":"Sunflowers at sunset","url":"https://unsplash.com/photos/oUxuOQfnhZQ"},"publishedAt":"2021-12-14","excerpt":"I am thrilled that Acorn Intelligence is a finalist for not one, but two categories for the inaugural Amazon Ads Partner Awards!

Unfortunately, in my experience, the idea of an MVP is frequently misunderstood and abused to deliver a project within a time box. After which, the product development team would pivot to another project. Not before making some very minor changes based upon user feedback.</p>\n<p>Unsurprisingly, this practice produced disappointing software and frustrated customers. Therefore, an MVP has to be more than just minimal functionality to delight our customers. Ideally, after the initial release, sustained development would satisfy all the desired outcomes and polish experiences that didn't perform as expected.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>However we choose to make an MVP, we need to make it meaningful.</p>\n<p><cite><a href=\"https://brianpagan.net/2015/lean-startup-mvp-how-to-make-meaningful-products/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Brian Pagán</a></cite></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Sadly I believe these behaviours stem from utilising an internal technology team as an onsite software agency. Furthermore, I suspect this comes from an I.T. project mentality to procure customer solutions for the current operational problems.</p>\n<p>These behaviours are the antithesis of modern software development and prevent organisations from becoming product companies. But through transparency, careful management of expectations, and autonomy, a product development team will deliver a valuable, usable, and feasible product.</p>\n<p>While the metaphors present in Henrik Kniberg article \"<a href=\"https://blog.crisp.se/2016/01/25/henrikkniberg/making-sense-of-mvp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Making sense of MVP (Minimum Viable Product) – and why I prefer Earliest Testable/Usable/Lovable</a>\" are perhaps a little confused.

For example, redefine an existing industry, time savings or financial returns.</li>\n<li>Is it feasible, and when can it be delivered?</li>\n<li>How will the product be monetised, subscriptions or advertising?</li>\n<li>Out of all the validated ideas, what is the core functionality?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In Kniberg's article, the \"skateboard release\" is a crucial point and first production release. Getting to this point is a big triumph and something to celebrate. But your initial version is where the real work starts. It's the point where we being collecting quantitive data from usage and qualitative feedback from customers under production conditions. That's the point of the MVP. Build enough to learn and improve. It will be quite an emotional point as we understand whether our initial version is valuable and usable. However, armed with this new information, we can start the journey of continuous discovery and iteration.</p>\n<p>Therefore, I think Kniberg is correct to recommend considering this initial release as your Earliest Testable Product. To that end, I feel that Product Managers should modify our language to suit the audience carefully convey this point. Highlighting it will take successive versions to produce the Earliest Loved Product.</p>\n<p>Effectively communicating this point is tricky, as most don't understand the Minimum Viable Product concept. Depending upon the audience, saying prototype may be divisive or confusing. So instead, choose to describe the collection of features as an initial release. Where appropriate, I want to talk about our software in this fashion, as I believe it prepares others to expect further releases to accomplish the desired outcomes.</p>\n<p><img class=\"g-image g-image--lazy g-image--loading\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1674 1056' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-c7c40d1298b2e698ef12028d1dffd654'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='40'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-c7c40d1298b2e698ef12028d1dffd654)' width='1674' height='1056' xlink:href='data:image/png%3bbase64%2ciVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAEAAAAAoCAYAAABOzvzpAAAACXBIWXMAAAsSAAALEgHS3X78AAAIeElEQVRo3sWayXIURxCG9QY%2bOvxCHHgFjhyI8Atg7CDssC8%2b%2bMqFkw7sYhcIBBJilUAS2kCjfUb7OhJCC9pmlO6vZnKoqanq7vFa4Y4R3ZVdlX/9%2bWdWtRuKxaLQzp49K69fvzZ/671QOz4%2bNr%2bFQkFGRkZkdHRURjIjksvmZHx8XLa2tqr66e/e3p58/PhRJiYmZGx0RKamJmVsbNT8O5fLmud2/5mZGRkeHjbvzOVyMjM9LQMD/TI7OxPZjZlxsV1dXa3YqS39mdtk9Hw0%2bh2P%2bk9OTsri4mJV3wZ19tKlS8bInkASANjy0g8fPkgmcig3N2Mmu7Oz4wXg8PAwmvxs5PiUjIxNyfJKXuYXV81EceTg4KCq//r6unk/zk5Hzi8srUn/4LBM5eZkZWXF3AcgHwBzc3OSyWRkbConS/l1mZiejcbJ1ALAKtLa2trMgGkA8PU5ym/KTFNr8HnNO3cHpZA5J7LV7%2b3nncN21Dd7XmSnP3Y%2bVbZDLSLN34tMvPU%2brwDw6NEjg6qNjo2o%2b7f5LbNnc25JOs%2bcl/HWTjm27tf0j36LhaOS/0M/yWTjNxEOP5bYFN339o/eVSjbrHWfk/Y/vpV8zw/lEDw0z2vnyDglv9Zazkjvr9/Jdudv5XEO/QxobW2Vzc3NGmRLEyiYi791wJIzZQC6ByTbNVQDlGeZov/K4GyPym7m92hVR8vPiuZ5nM3%2bRkYybT/LwcZw%2bVExcZzdfJ8Md/wiR7tZr00FgAcPHpiYQcC4EKQ0oVAJgQj1o8MjL3NCdD0siGGMmXCdIRc3t%2bM6bCoA3Lp1S27cuCEvX76U9vZ2efr0qTx58kQeP35s2MHvs2fP5P3790YsFxYWZHl5uSJcPubYbKmmacnpvb3dr4zgptcp27YoX744NkEGaJgWjE3pPbU2VSGg6cus6NFRZPhFPn36ZMRxY2PDOIxiky4RTS5AQj8AjBQHMKFQ8gHy1ZHjuOUvY%2bOwKpahx35hDAHgimDaBgNwmPTW19dnQAGMhw8fyosXLwxbXEAUjN3d3XjV92QGFqWeVJ1kUwEAirv51He5ohhqnz9/NqAAAuxCYwBIx9BxeE9azeAXZtYLQJyNFwCXqm6a8f3bBsc3ECwYGhoy4zQ3NxstASR7wm5K8zmThjH12FRpgD0h92V2GvTFMnQuWvlfLx8gaE1/f7/cvHnTjEvJGweE/bdbZaYBgLklAnD//n1DUUpFykgED%2bHT%2bjyu2SERmrg65oYNoolu3Lt3zwisqxO%2bwqheAOJsGjQ%2bmpqazPXq1SuT7jQVskItLS0mhrl4htqb2jyavALoAmKzxEdJnrM3sDUDvbhz547Z5Njv%2blc1QNEhnalaus5AISbIhdPEr4IEOLDn%2bfPnZpNjp1I3/bnM0LCxQYTiHR0dcvfu3crGxd6hxtH5L4WAFjKIE7R3VzCp7e/vG6fZBQKKAkKM5/P5GjBDgqR6oQ1b3gPI6rz9vN4NW6h/w5s3b%2bpKg7bah9IgxVNvb28FDELGprs6Ani%2bELEdZat9/fr1ilDaJXra2oFxggyA%2bgqAFkIhyobEjUb4aKzZDSGlcrx9%2b7bRF6Wj2sSlWJv2hIQe2NghEQIhNQBUgDQEz45fW7Xj4thHNTtt2hOmDiD1sd9QRvjea7/fZkNnZ6fJFu6zJBBiQ0BR5cXv3r0zwgOFQy1UB7CavjrApTRtYGDA0Lqnp8e7onFsICSuXLki29vbsSCkLoXfvi2dlLAypCBQhg3ELxUbqYm0RAzaceyCAf1DKc8%2bQtO/6c84UFsn6BM5e9L6HK26fPmyCa8QCKnToBY6bhrkPrEHI2AGQAAK1%2bDgYFVN71N4X1j4aE09gTPZbDaYKWxbdYZwxU4zjQtC6lJYqYUWaBoMxQuDUNNTBwCYpjtb2NIIqN5TzcEpGNjd3R37Ds3p6ixhAAhawrthVFcpHJcGQymPCQAG%2bkG%2bVkom5Ww7JOx%2bLAJFkA8EVwvUDr0CBK1n6i2fvecBocHjAOGImnimGNJQiltJXXmXFewLeEfIGTvV6tzZdlPGh9Jpqu0wlFZlTSpjfQqvkwUIJoPSxym85nffSjEXLdDs2PbRWZ8Tioiqj32pQoAMwKDU8/Pz8zWdk/K17QANKqMRmjlCIhWiK2HFIa3rkO8dNouTbIIAsGqkPUpYFJ%2bdH4oPsvrBJI7WWtbaIKDs5Oy1tTUvCKFSWBu2qis6rl3V%2bRbh2rVrVSueWAnaIWCnQe6jrpwRaPqDGaFS1HXGVmoc4YzBXRm3rrfF0XzUiIDjpNp%2b7n4/dG2oV1jIEGipRdBtS0tL5qCT8wFV3FAB4lITEbp69arZSifR07WlUOvq6kpV9dmLiRal2TNUpUEtKuIUn4%2bYOKNsUHtfKWxPAC0gXWmZzX13MxSqFwhPzfU%2bQXP7wxLqCr0XWwrrBEMA%2bGgNA6jlbZTdUtjHBIoowLNBiRNF7YcwMz8NtTQsoKjSwsr96pwKAPflvjKWleHzdVzh49px7qc7UDfFhYolPbN0P976dn%2b2HV%2b7NAuFbKoAiPs87qM1jRVFqUE5rSYwFidIdniFxtTnfGAhtn0HqyGwqVJhgXvSnMgA9wjcd2l1hY0qdZKNTow41sotyca2gwUaAklz1IxBPeHrryfZVYeiaY7AfY3dYWNjY102pFeEqp5GRkBI62n6VSrUKgBQx3Oyy/kdxQ%2blbNJFPw4oqPpOnjxpKAcYSTZUa%2bTqEydOpBoPsDiTINxOnTpl/uZekg1hdvHiRTl9%2brTRKubHWPxvNaT0CxcuSIPGBVthqkA6YJzm0r4MyGD12AAUKdW%2bl2QD2GSetDY4jLMAps7zjKM5Nl0sekO9X4P/yfZ/jVsVAu7ePI0o/d1LRQ0GED4cknJibJ/z/Rdz4PoTkutuRW4vOz8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=' /%3e%3c/svg%3e\" width=\"1674\" alt=\"Minimal Product Timeline\" data-srcset=\"/assets/static/2021-09-24-minimal-viable-product-timeline.82a2fbd.242b87976ea0defa957451ef0e3ed9d2.png 480w, /assets/static/2021-09-24-minimal-viable-product-timeline.cbab2cf.242b87976ea0defa957451ef0e3ed9d2.png 1024w, /assets/static/2021-09-24-minimal-viable-product-timeline.ad86e53.242b87976ea0defa957451ef0e3ed9d2.png 1674w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 1674px) 100vw, 1674px\" data-src=\"/assets/static/2021-09-24-minimal-viable-product-timeline.ad86e53.242b87976ea0defa957451ef0e3ed9d2.png\"><noscript><img class=\"g-image g-image--lazy g-image--loaded\" src=\"/assets/static/2021-09-24-minimal-viable-product-timeline.ad86e53.242b87976ea0defa957451ef0e3ed9d2.png\" width=\"1674\" alt=\"Minimal Product Timeline\"></noscript></p>\n<p>As the product development team includes ideas postponed from the skateboard release, you'll edge closer to the desired MVP and later on a Viable Product.

To close out this short essay, I'd like to leave you with a few closing thoughts which might help you in future.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Use MVP sparingly as it's a loaded term, and be upfront with everyone about the scope.</li>\n<li>To help articulate the vision, try writing out the validated ideas as desired Outcomes or ORKs. These techniques will give further structure and allow you to translate them to Epics and Stories easily.</li>\n<li>Prioritise your Stories carefully to be lean. It may seem obvious, but prioritising the wrong items can be expensive. Try using the User Story Mapping technique to help confirm priorities to achieve the desired outcome and avoid confirmation bias.</li>\n<li>Find a noun appropriate for your organisation to best label the initial release. Skateboard may work for you.

These requests will come from managers and stakeholders who wish to track the planned outputs against deadlines or due to legacy Project Management Office behaviours.</p>\n<p>Regardless of the catalysts, these requests come from good intentions. However, your organisation will likely be too focused on shipping features and meeting arbitrary timescales to sate customer requests instead of solving real problems. If this sounds familiar, I recommend reading Escaping the Build Trap by Melissa Perri. This approach will likely focus on delivering features that do not meet expectations causing dissatisfying for customers and stakeholders alike.</p>\n<p>Instead, prefer a <a href=\"https://www.prodpad.com/blog/how-to-build-a-product-roadmap-everyone-understands/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">theme-based roadmap</a>. This roadmap style requires you to focus on customers problems we intend to solve or experiments we want to run and longer-term bets.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Themes are a Promise to Solve Problems, Not Build Features.</p>\n<p><cite><a href=\"https://articles.uie.com/themes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Jared M. Spool</a></cite></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You then arrange these themes across different time horizons covering the Present, Near Term and Future. They're usually labelled as Now, Next and Later. Items closer to the present will be better smaller, better-understood items with more explicit scope, just like your product backlog. These time horizons are the real differentiator - as traditional roadmaps list promised features arranged across a timeline with pre-agreed specifications and delivery dates.</p>\n<p>Using a theme-based roadmap gives you the flexibility to reprioritise themes based upon customer needs while discovering how to realise the product vision.</p>\n<h3 id=\"so-how-does-a-theme-based-roadmap-work\"><a href=\"#so-how-does-a-theme-based-roadmap-work\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>So how does a theme-based roadmap work?</h3>\n<p>Much like a backlog of user stories, you'll priorities the opportunities and problems. Next, you'll arrange these themes over three or four columns. From left to right, they'll read Now, Next and Later. Once complete, you'll have produced something which resembles an agile board.</p>\n<p><img class=\"g-image g-image--lazy g-image--loading\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0

As you move further to the right-hand side, you'll find items with more ambiguity. I am currently using Now, Next, Later and Ideas. The Later column on my roadmap contains fluffy titles for candidate projects requiring discovery. In contrast, the Ideas column is a backlog for problems and new ideas to replenish our Later column periodically.</p>\n<p>However, you can adjust the labels for each time horizon to best convene the current and future work. For example, you may decide that renaming Later to read H2 2021 is helpful while retraining those used to traditional timelines.</p>\n<h3 id=\"so-whats-it-like-using-a-theme-based-roadmap\"><a href=\"#so-whats-it-like-using-a-theme-based-roadmap\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>So what's it like using a theme-based roadmap?</h3>\n<p>After using this framework for the last couple of years, I honestly believe arranging initiatives in this manner changes everyone's mindset when discussing our roadmap in our <a href=\"https://svpg.com/the-product-council/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Product Council</a> meetings. Instead of discussing the delivery of a single feature, we have conversations about our customer's problems and goals. In addition, as we release each new iteration, we collect further feedback to confirm how well we solved the problem. Our roadmap has become the communication tool that facilitates these discussions.

With a bit of artistic flair, I found one can easily layout screen controls in <a href=\"https://balsamiq.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Balsamiq</a> to draw enough to show what a webpage could or should do. Just like this 'Mind the Product' article says, \"<a href=\"https://www.mindtheproduct.com/wireframes-arent-just-for-designers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Wireframes Aren’t Just for Designers</a>\". They're a thinking and communication tool for Product Managers.</p>\n<p>I am positive they're a great way to help form your ideas when you're while ideating. If you're prepared to use Balsamiq or pen and paper, they'll provide you with the agility to further assess a hypothesis, fail quickly and learn more. It's easy to become preoccupied with find this solution. However, it's always important to remember there is a team around you to help you do the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The role of a product manager is to discover a product that is valuable, usable, and feasible.</p>\n<p><cite><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0981690408/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Inspired: How to Create Products Customers Love by Marty Cagan</a></cite></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Your wireframes will be a helpful communication tool to share the ideas you've distilled with your teammates during a discovery meeting. Similar to a storyboard used in film and television to convey the protagonist's journey. Ideally, the team's designer will revise your concept and produce a Hi-Fi clickable prototype. Next, you should validate these ideas with your stakeholders. Or, better still, perform some initial user testing. Ultimately your initial wireframes, you should be able to learn:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Has the team discovered a solution to the customer's problem?</li>\n<li>Can this be built?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I hope you give it a try.</p>\n"}},{"node":{"path":"/blog/working-backwards-from-a-fake-press-release/","title":"Working Backwards From A Fake Press Release","subtype":"post","authors":["Matthew Akino-Wittering"],"figure":{"caption":"Unsplash","img":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/2021-04-23-working-backwards-from-a-fake-press-release.0b85c65.0c0a26e2d76ff4c92d858473faf4f283.jpg","size":{"width":1920,"height":1080},"sizes":"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px","srcset":["/assets/static/2021-04-23-working-backwards-from-a-fake-press-release.1b91758.0c0a26e2d76ff4c92d858473faf4f283.jpg 480w","/assets/static/2021-04-23-working-backwards-from-a-fake-press-release.3df3210.0c0a26e2d76ff4c92d858473faf4f283.jpg 1024w","/assets/static/2021-04-23-working-backwards-from-a-fake-press-release.0b85c65.0c0a26e2d76ff4c92d858473faf4f283.jpg 1920w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1920 1080' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-d0aa8538ff3c53f61d70119275d07566'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='40'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-d0aa8538ff3c53f61d70119275d07566)' width='1920' height='1080' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%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%2bGbCU%2b6SzXLd4zgEkeOP00wx8JbuRlII5B%2bCQaJbdwrulJlLoJMfckyP76cKBalVeS2DDHEpd3c4CqBkk/TUin9KlOsEo3mG7szCC5VERkUsrMAW6HHQ9RrltiLZkRv2maSIjJSWBFPxHgdBO0/tFimrcP2r9cwm9DPYhVSCRAZOWPm6%2bJC5z8dBeEeP9ukv1ksSvhnVD7Hj103pSD7vA9y1K7u38PEVz0BUHQS3efbLxGypFVsKpD2EQc658lOOh%2bOr5JS2%2bf8AmVoDn1QaH2ODeH7JYvtkIZjklMqT%2bR0dLL3F9Qn9jl9bPBFRQ2e6Z0Hyzp/jkOoR2Hz2KduzUV2ej3HeAMfcPNgdfz1ZEuoVY8wVVGSW6DHrny10R5RhJUwvLZirV5J7EiRQxqXeRzgKo8ST6amXbNxXTm4cg2bb76ynd5RDYkrHvDFXA5pD082GFH9R9NK/arxJuXEVZKfDSWLG0REm1LHhEssPBVLHLKMeQwT8tRpXqXXeai8tHc4SEMTqBHI33WGfZJ8M%2bGcfPRctOBRjeS93NqpcdcP7fuO17At6jSJrClYIjdUAGOQj6fprvwfsnZzT3JY22WvtG8IQe53BMMp8uVmOP8aXvs/3JJeJJi8U%2bWpsSOc4T2gCCvmc9P8Ajqp7vap77LPSr1K24MoMUztjuofg0o6lvwJ19SNGLtcimknwOUQUKMYIx0OumRqNvwnxpwxK83CXEENqtkt%2b7ri4UD0U9R/qfidDL3bTvWzZpb5wm9fdV8FLuEk8vZAVifoTqWGvwD9llt4FroipiZuR8jxAzjTVxfus8ME1QJE0Ei8rq655gfEHrra2nHqSXYWbkrz0VDnAcYwvTl6HqvpjGo3xORBuO030Ve%2buxlbC49mQc2Oo%2bOtraykOJdPs80q9mxxAbCNI9V0roxdslDkkNg4Pujx9NWmvtdWpCkcUYAQYBwAcfTA1tbUWCpZPHcKSTlvlnprg6hmwwB5fA%2bmtratAP//Z' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"},"alt":"Designed sketching wireframes","url":"https://unsplash.com/photos/s9CC2SKySJM"},"publishedAt":"2021-04-23","excerpt":"I've recently become involved with figuring out the vision for a major new product capability.

This idea has excited many colleagues with the possibilities our successful experiment. However, as there are many competing ideas and overlapping viewpoints, it's become obvious that arriving early at a conscious will be crucial.</p>\n<p>To help find an acceptable middle ground for everyone, I felt it important to try a different technique and firm up our ideas. I chose to write a fake press release and described what we'd like to announce at launch. Initially, I thought this a slightly daunting task but after reading <a href=\"https://mattyford.com/blog/2014/3/12/working-backwards-press-release-a-product-development-framework\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Matty Ford's blog post from 2014</a> I found the concept of working backwards very straightforward. The provided template helped me capture the key information and organise my thoughts. I was also encouraged to try the technique after learning it's been tried and tested by Amazon.</p>\n<p>I found the concept of working backwards really helpful and recommend experimenting with it yourselves. I found it cut down the waffle and focus on what was important to share with the reader. Where we find agreement, we'll have a common vision which will become our Minimal-Viable-Product or <a href=\"https://blog.crisp.se/2016/01/25/henrikkniberg/making-sense-of-mvp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Skateboard Version</a>.</p>\n<p>Where your stakeholders and development team find unacceptable gaps you should thoroughly discuss those concerns being careful of emotions. The benefit of a fake press release is you can quickly iterate on the content with your stakeholders until you find a shared agreement. Similarly, you could go through the same process of trimming the fat to find a lean deliverable.</p>\n<p>This would then allow us to enter the market sooner, and begin testing these ideas with real users. From there, we can iterate, adjusting the product and working towards our much larger vision.</p>\n<p>I hope you experiment with this idea for yourself and find it helpful.</p>\n"}},{"node":{"path":"/blog/preach/","title":"Preach!","subtype":"post","authors":["Matthew Akino-Wittering"],"figure":{"caption":"@RMBanfield","img":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/2019-11-09-preach-richard-banfield.0b85c65.132fb07b4b71c63013d452de2b7ad87e.jpg","size":{"width":1920,"height":1080},"sizes":"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px","srcset":["/assets/static/2019-11-09-preach-richard-banfield.1b91758.132fb07b4b71c63013d452de2b7ad87e.jpg 480w","/assets/static/2019-11-09-preach-richard-banfield.3df3210.132fb07b4b71c63013d452de2b7ad87e.jpg 1024w","/assets/static/2019-11-09-preach-richard-banfield.0b85c65.132fb07b4b71c63013d452de2b7ad87e.jpg 1920w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1920 1080' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-a956d079d2df686e46954391c12a7160'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='40'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-a956d079d2df686e46954391c12a7160)' width='1920' height='1080' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%2c/9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAkAEADASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGgAAAgMBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAABQcAAwYEAv/EADoQAAECBQEEBAsIAwAAAAAAAAECAwAEBQYRIQcSEzEiUWGRFBYyQUJSYrLBwtEIFRcjcnSBsYOhw//EABoBAAIDAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMFAgQGAAH/xAArEQABBAEBBgQHAAAAAAAAAAABAAIDEQQFBhITIXGRIlFSsRUxMjNBoeH/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AFTL2Y4%2bw7MPBhtlMp94cIJI30rQsgAjlgp5coztLsaszzUtONpluC6lLo3nRqk68vhDSS83O25Ul6nwWiJb0JGMBcWWkk%2bLlK/at%2b6Ie65GIcl0bRQ/gRtlYBqbXOybsD8dSl7%2bHNwvM8ErkeEFFSd53VOcZ5DsHdFiNlddcHSmqeP8ij8sOBsEAR0NZ7YTlxf9S1/wPEb8r7pRy2yGslQJqFOGOsLUPdgq3sfqC5EsuVKR4hd4hew6TjGN3d8n%2bcZhqM5z5472idND3QDIfJu008kN%2bkYreYH7Sfl9h8zxEKVXmEqBGCmWUcd6oP7EabISFDmp96oOomVzLrDiSrCMNkbqgM8zkwzmPLSD1iF/scbS5atQCkoyipzIyTj1TEdMlmkkcyQ8gs1reNHAxu4KtZK2nMWheSj6NOUP9KjW2UhxNs0wNhOss1zXu%2biO2MhIsuM2JeLgUUjwRKSMc8rA%2bMMi0pB5Fs0nd30gyjJ0OPQEabaV957z09gj7LR8PiN6IgFT5GFraKTpgzOnvdkegJlGiuErTzP5%2baOlEo%2bMdNzT2jFqJeYSRhbneYQcQLWBleS5wJtZ0WAAOSXvqYtbE0g6uHA6nR9Y6UMPjkpfXziwNP41UvESsOFLxwNVQXltKg42VkEkgZ3gYwOxM71vV9o8kVR4gdpSPpDCZllBaOifKH9wt9iiXS3dUu1jo1EqOe3eHwieBGGz9VmNoG3E3qilkW9JXBI1ilT3FTKzLaOJwlbqjheQM46wIN%2bITckltmTuO5WGkIwlCZ0YSBgADKTpEiQ314XlyE%2bY9gkzXuYfCaQypUqoyCcsXVcB1A6bzSvP2twBqFVr8kDw7jqS8eulg/8AOJEhAQrLJ5fUe6Au37dDCMirrWfbl2T8kD17WLsaXjwyXX%2bqVb%2bAiRI5WGTy%2bo91a3tfupKh%2bZInHXLJjYfZ9cM3OXKt4DLwbeUBoN4lef7iRIsYv3Ag5b3PZ4ja/9k=' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"},"alt":"Your roadmap should be a sequence of problems you want to solve, not features.
