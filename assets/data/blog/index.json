Additionally, our market knowledge will grow, allowing us to discuss those apparent opportunities with our Design and Engineering colleagues for further investigation.</p>\n<p>Some conversations will be challenging, and Product Managers must keep their <a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/theevabea/status/1605252972753129472\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">biases</a> in check to ensure we hear the opinions of our Customers and Stakeholders. Otherwise, our thinking has built-in prejudices that will stop us from learning about their situation. Articles such as <a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/theevabea/status/1605252972753129472\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Leading without being the Boss by Roman Pichler</a> are helpful because they reinforce how attentiveness, curiosity, openness, and integrity make for effective <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servant_leadership\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">servant leadership</a>.</p>\n<p>It will be challenging. Company leadership and the Sales team will push us to \"Build first, ask questions later\", as their remuneration might depend upon a particular improvement. In a Product-led organisation, everyone should lean in and share their point of view to benefit customers. That requires all parties to collaborate, avoid conflict, and achieve alignment that serves the customer while remaining focused on our shared <a href=\"https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/mission-vision-strategy-goals-roadmap\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Mission, Vision, and Strategy</a>.</p>\n<p>Increasingly, I view Sales and Customer Success as an extension to the core Product teamâ€”an intelligence network allowing us to draw on the broadest insight as they're speaking to customers more regularly than anyone from the Product team. As a result, you're more likely to be aware of changes in the market sooner, and various unmet customer needs they're confident we can fulfil. But, as Gabrielle says below, it's our job, Product Managers, to work with Sales.</p>\n<div class=\"twitter-embed\">\n    <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" align=\"center\" data-dnt=\"true\" data-theme=\"light\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">as a PM in a B2B company, it is YOUR job to work well with sales.<br><br>when sales goes out to sell without alignment with product, they&#39;re selling demand. it makes sense - they&#39;re commission based &amp; have targets to hit.<br><br>it&#39;s your job to paint them a picture of the product to sell.</p>&mdash; Gabrielle Bufrem (@gbufremsays) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gbufremsays/status/1605973420864180227?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 22, 2022</a></blockquote>\n\n</div>\n<p>If we're all working in concert, we can get under the skin of the problems that matter. We can then move forward and explore how we'll solve them. That requires a two-way conversation with both disciplines sharing crucial information to develop a shared understanding and begin the journey to a <a href=\"https://www.pendo.io/product-led/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Product-led organisation</a>. Additionally, it will need collaboration with the customer to support further problem discovery and confirmation. It is challenging, but we need to cut through this cacophony of noise to extract the necessary information to solve the problems that resonate with our users. The objective must be to create a delightful experience and ethical triggers that drive our users' regular usage.</p>\n<p><figure><img class=\"g-image g-image--lazy g-image--loading\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 740 520' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-6669dfa9572d3c8c2b0ec5d3bccb5fc9'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='40'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-6669dfa9572d3c8c2b0ec5d3bccb5fc9)' width='740' height='520' xlink:href='data:image/png%3bbase64%2ciVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAEAAAAAtCAYAAAAeA21aAAAACXBIWXMAAAsSAAALEgHS3X78AAAJVElEQVRo3s1aa1MTWRru7ijXGpXBEVALcVRoEq7hDlGGS0hIgCQEE8XLzDB4F3S9ji6jjCLQIAnozNTU1nzY3drdqq2aH7Cf9g/sT9gP%2b1Pc53TO6Zw0nXSHBKWrnjonJ6e7z3nPe39bELirbnVDqF%2bNqX3S8mBj%2bbi8gQhri4HP%2bLGdXClrVmKCrMR3tnbd5sVkP64niJj60ni2BBBp6wDO8mNZX4uLRocmqlB2cIj8BLJxq3OzuUaDUZG2dsDFj%2bVy%2blbnmk6oW9kgFDwHfAWcAr4ECijKgZNAWR44wA64cuKAVCIcAfxANRCkbRVwFCg0JYKOVU4ATqAdGAfmgdvAI2CaEIIXkew4IMJxQCRnDuDWPETXFwbcwChd82XgOJ0jWmYTeUXTA2XAMOWKCqA0NxHILwHYxgCp6s0W6RfhUPbr12dZBNoe/1E4%2brd/CqF%2bt%2bA%2bf1lsf/hc6rz3ROq9eU9icx1LayJ3n/pyGZxgVxKamMGujsVTxjyTFxMiAAJ4qQ7w7pAAZhtzKFQpKpRQigkRjv39d7UdCU%2bnnXNu5pZk9HK7Yo0jPOHpBAFCFxwgxjnS75l7aGPWhYlUNopNb7YZZM6CmT7TG4zolVQn0EdMFdBIzVY3UET%2bd92YU%2bfZVzbK7asxu0q46NdCx%2bMFsfv%2bU7Fl4ZXUtLgskbb55RuJjPXP3hGeCgn6TbjHa4ODPqfBpiQmq/bljayVbG5OSjDCa%2btDwBGgCjgJlAGV2oQPHyhbxZft61sf6tc2w/L6lk9e2wzI65vj6E/Uq/2tcdaScdI/s/mL2/ns5a2OR8%2bf1MZ%2bGgARe6i1OZAqWvFtym7XN49WAsqA/VBORUDBaCiKfqTYF4raMH4QKBmZunTg2rEvC1p%2beO1serk80z3/uNx1/W5V76175X035r6AqBx23ZgvOzd7u7Ln7oPyvpvzVd1zDysxdgQbLz87e9sNhKp/%2b2slCEAsjgeYolr8NM8RjAj23eQGjgClwAAgAz2AE2gEXEAtbWVwQxvkuCMw6DsZdg01%2bv2hGt/4VI9vLCyPBiItQGdgcLQmOOBtvdzQXhE%2bO%2by4Wtd8bOjiNz1Qrp3TzV2NE%2b6xVgMRIJYmAETAASV6ItR/DCLk66qN/3ykbuN9l7y2NSK/fTcMMRiACEQx9lPLwutfhqa/7SPzOh98T5SghBPmrUsNcI04NNuIsBrfRQ5IBitE/puAZqCGog4oZPMgFtDmUSEw7Bc6Hj4TQwOehEVYidVhoRehHCfB3i34XYP2FHAc8IEQP0A5vhu4MqvGAhAFSafRbbRP7Pl32PBpPRE%2bBgEOA2eAVkqI0wSeieQ8nGBiwykxhMq%2bk8Aho/dA%2be0n7Xc1ciVERvUD/P5JUaaKjsk52yztzxK3lvfmdlUpmoWnHvo/k0nu9CC3sW5t4UrCpFGNLvKuKJRoUzpHiHseO/FSwgkgjsQCNat%2bRy7xuuoTUGh9T%2bB8yjxukWeJP077Nm0TLCylJzt84WrCFSbBUJpoUOe8sOe3EP%2beH9sVq8A2SE7ZHQwzQiRODe3IeJTKeUoCpRC4khAHLn9gcEpWYwEdERjbTzNf4aP4BhZcUXY6xI67rCiqbIMhe0LE2DNbCafpdcSn2jx/Mn4u5Mx4MtkSQMcJB4izpHmKueoBovlVcxaI0jYLTJwXiDMMr44ot2jjjyuq6er/9iZRapnupdFgxJEkQERKN588a/DSDLEejNhhiJ8qBr13/pDVmrW9kn3ny%2bc58dtfCuDcTO0gNUa8yV7LN7DYY21zDI5URb5sv0Sys1hMMWutAmas5Hb58X3O719UNyythRcFweaOXCnxmt4LVxtcgL4T/SHqUJVmuoc8Ey50KSFB42vFg%2biy6T%2bCIJL3ZbNmEs8knhfBOiM2gQY9IQwG0QZJaxVYVAgOzNhXX1%2bb6br35NWYL%2bRHbBDymt9L3ucD5oBneO8oHcv0riB59rg3MNpz58Ez1/W5%2bbHRoI%2bMZbdmdY8BtFNANeRhOin/RG6zQOvzRZF6gWoykvSbXyyJWJTZvUwJOrissJTpHqIHoGOYJegHZPV9L9%2bI2a6byL7aD1zIUX6oTCL%2bL4aTozoPJ/70Z%2btp8UBUywqjb5oSQ2Al0fzDGHCU9Cv/8XserACliEYZi/D7JtVntLxYIqcStS%2b/Va1A%2b6PnCSuQDimFkaQnmOn0%2b27OCw1L60krsBo7qL574VXWnMv2mrMVoC4u7wdUc0nS3fIDSExwXvM4lU/vCTICNJFCSr49wfpknY%2b9pwEY3EueIOvvI7FAvWKew8uKANsDoijwxZ6IBQwW5%2bLiAVs6LsgmGNI9v5aUvFLG9oAIqHCsaSf/DbjgcKY8nhkBWDU6RcSUuESTIsXJBOkn3ry%2bNEXbQ8B1bGLfdiLETAnAcgf6Oh76V1mmeFfTYnkShWo1manEC7clR9B6U8rjES0jZJQTpL9JcdO5JzfPm0TdAo/RjG6NroYoIoKT6KYdLCPkujHHSmN8HvBzYAZo1Mv9niOAvGKYwioBLtDyern%2bHt/4VD1C6l4DjiqlpW7C9hUpKTBOP%2by5yyiPR/sycV5o1afbsfy29uC//l2C6M6JaG5Q%2bO//CjB2in6LEKREa9uWdeKTr2rFOa71d0umBX21Vv%2bf0XyjjBHH0u1wY92I5z0Ipu63PVlYqIu999pXNkhZrJudOJcKE62sK1PJfEcfehlthIe6wPVftUpuoqqzYXgi/D385R8LyxADAxHYvnHOyuizx2LN%2b2XDNerfa5lTeDZmXpfBnMI040Uai5KsMUuJr2kurdR1/6lNrwR77qrfB6jVITvmystqgSRls/JqoiYgK7AqSvwzEEr9UqXp9a9m%2b/kc67BZ5gCOAKQsFaIeXgfQRb%2b9GVIdnsTvDloP6GZybhYQmTtC2mk30me2UQwAzYAPGKGf7TjqFfWjrh76fzvNHPfRuWTskpxNNYkjQBH9UsxJX%2bCmpesgR4wg9c99NFDpNvPTzb4S495fQTc5TN9fR9/jpe0oXR%2bxNmdoOe4SLbN76D2EEH1Gom1ZB6Tk6FfjNv1Yg7KlmxOzlhBJfCfYl64yZNH/KOCUppSptrBTK8ArlKR2VrT/JCNlZ5EDGoD%2bDByQVrExfWGgJHnFnKIIHWvvduZDaOZG9w2uXTNDfPCSNE2OxZ/Nao8HSAXaSjE2k5nOxdz9H2FS7wwszJPqAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC' /%3e%3c/svg%3e\" width=\"740\" alt=\"The Hooked Model by Nir Eyal\" data-srcset=\"/assets/static/2023-02-05-the-hooked-model.5ca271b.16874f8004c6b314784b15cd86b42d09.png 740w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" data-src=\"/assets/static/2023-02-05-the-hooked-model.5ca271b.16874f8004c6b314784b15cd86b42d09.png\"><noscript><img class=\"g-image g-image--lazy g-image--loaded\" src=\"/assets/static/2023-02-05-the-hooked-model.5ca271b.16874f8004c6b314784b15cd86b42d09.png\" width=\"740\" alt=\"The Hooked Model by Nir Eyal\"></noscript><figcaption>The Hooked Model by Nir Eyal</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>Lastly, if we identify what's truly important to our customers, we'll see the results in our data.

I've spent time dwelling on this topic because there is a vast gulf in expectations between all parties.</p>\n<p>In my 12 years in Product Management, it's always been challenging to learn from peers and thought leaders the behaviours and techniques that should be present in your product management toolkit. Unfortunately, despite the wealth of helpful content covering anecdotes, case studies and theory, it's tantamount to navel-gazing.</p>\n<p>So to help me ponder a few topics, such as communication and empathy, I'm writing here to share my thoughts and offer insights into the product management craft, with the hope it will provide valuable insights to a broader audience. Unfortunately, product management regularly gets distilled into this combative quip.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>   Customers want outputs. Product Managers want outcomes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The statement above, or variations on the theme, get bounded about on Twitter and Podcasts. To many, it may seem counter-intuitive as product managers work with colleagues trained to design and build software to produce new or improved artefacts for our customers.</p>\n<p>In contrast, the role of a product manager is to provide information that ensures their team discovers valuable and usable solutions to customer problems - a process called Product Discovery and a critical topic not discussed outside of product circles. Finally, it's the responsibility of the team's engineering talent will ensure that their solution is feasible and reliable.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/rDqQcmVqAm4?t=2088\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview</a> has a fantastic description of taking ideas, comments and feedback through a process where a team has the space to explore and polish those initial thoughts to become Usable, Valuable and Feasible products that customers love.</p>\n<p>That said, the team's output wouldnâ€™t always be new features. Instead, it could be better documentation, scaling to improve stability or bug fixing. Unfortunately, where an output-focused culture prevails, the product development teams are stuck \"Building for the Sake of Building\".

In short, software teams in this situation are subordinate to Sales, Marketing and Operational departments working as an internal development agency. Where software teams aren't empowered to collaborate with customers, they become a feature factory producing pet projects for senior leaders, building features written into contracts by the Sales Team or writing software without speaking to customers.</p>\n<p>Whatever the cause, they'll find themselves writing software with diminished usefulness and overall quality that lacks a certain 'je ne sais quoi', as they aren't solving 'real' problems that create positive change for their customers. What a nightmare! So what's the solution?</p>\n<p>There isn't a silver bullet or framework you can adopt to solve this problem miraculously. But, product managers can minimise tensions for their customers, stakeholders and leaders by approaching these conversations with empathy and transparency to explain how ideas move first to product discovery. Furthermore, only some ideas, once polished, will move on to product delivery and the reasons why. Finally, we all need to remember everyone wants a positive result for the company, but it takes empathy and concerted efforts from everyone involved to get on the same page.</p>\n"}},{"node":{"path":"/blog/why-i-use-product-narrative-and-loglines-to-aid-my-storytelling/","title":"Why I use Product Narrative and Loglines to aid my storytelling","subtype":"post","figure":{"caption":"Unsplash","img":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/2022-03-21-why-i-use-product-narrative-and-loglines-to-aid-my-storytelling.0b85c65.f72d77d4223e2a561264ee75ea310b76.jpg","size":{"width":1920,"height":1080},"sizes":"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px","srcset":["/assets/static/2022-03-21-why-i-use-product-narrative-and-loglines-to-aid-my-storytelling.1b91758.f72d77d4223e2a561264ee75ea310b76.jpg 480w","/assets/static/2022-03-21-why-i-use-product-narrative-and-loglines-to-aid-my-storytelling.3df3210.f72d77d4223e2a561264ee75ea310b76.jpg 1024w","/assets/static/2022-03-21-why-i-use-product-narrative-and-loglines-to-aid-my-storytelling.0b85c65.f72d77d4223e2a561264ee75ea310b76.jpg 1920w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1920 1080' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-faa5862d53766afcbfd5e832cccdcf72'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='40'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-faa5862d53766afcbfd5e832cccdcf72)' width='1920' height='1080' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%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%2beiXmsrjNO3gH6j0JbYiJoj8OlBXX21n8qgYAB%2b0zS6gBiB48H3E2W31K6q7cDVaYfxlnH9V77u3UIr%2ba6hLRWcqFpRAD%2b0AxeFVkX/eGj6PZRdH5T04J6fpB7aseI3upIMDuQ5hHEUjPRY9XEoaqMXQwdlM5wJ%2bjXqQCpnp0GJJI2ZaBbUHMA1aDtPEkkplx6I9WoBMW3CSSDYzEEcQawe8kkGwy6f/Z' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"},"alt":"Grey ceiling lamp and teal wall","url":"https://unsplash.com/photos/pxoZSTdAzeU"},"publishedAt":"2022-03-21","excerpt":"Iâ€™m incredibly fortunate to have had the opportunity to forge a career in product management for close to 12 years.

Even with the ups and downs it invariably brings, it's a perfect fit for my interests. Like many, I enjoy taking on customer problems we've discovered and pursuing valuable solutions. However, this behaviour is far from my initial product management experience specifying the desired functionality in Product Requirements Documents, handing over the work to an engineering team, and reviewing the output. At this point, I had yet to understand the value of storytelling.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, within a year, or two, I went through a company transformation workshop led by Marty Cagan. Then, I saw the proverbial light and read <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3ZUSJUY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Inspired</a> from cover to cover. The experience taught me that an empowered multi-discipline product development team with co-located members would outperform others when they can articulate the vision, customer problems and desired outcomes.</p>\n<p>Fast forward a few years, I found myself stuck on how best to onboard, share and retain knowledge as team members rotated. When well organised, the structure of Sprints and the temporary nature of User Stories don't have a negative impact. We were well-versed in decomposing the problem, enhancing the product, and shipping frequently. We even established a pattern of release twice a week. Problems only arose when we needed to refer to something we'd learnt three or more months ago, which had since become assumed knowledge. As our work covered bulk data collection and ingestion, the typical answer to this problem was creating yet another page on the wiki to retain requirements in technical documentation for troubleshooting at a later time. Unfortunately, this documentation was only an artefact to help capture the development requirements for engineers and quality assurance. It said nothing about the customer or the intended purpose of the dataset. At the time, I felt this was a massive gap in my \"product toolkit\" and the team's knowledge.</p>\n<p>As I see it, one of the many benefits of the web, especially social networks, is the serendipity of learning something helpful but unexpected. A personal example of this was coming across Karthik Raman's article, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-i-started-writing-product-narratives-karthik-raman/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Why I started writing Product Narratives</a> in 2017. Karthik recommends structuring your narratives in prose to describe the end-to-end experience of my product in a very conversational tone.</p>\n<p>I adopted this idea and used the concept to construct a brief narrative for each User Story. By doing so, I can better outline the context of the problem and the outcome. Writing Product Narratives has helped me focus my mind, identify the core ideas worth solving, and shelve others to ship early. In addition, Iâ€™d recommend working through a process of seeking peer feedback to ensure the narrative team meets the objectives.</p>\n<p>We use these narratives as the North Star to keep us honest while building out a significant change to the product. Then, when the product needs to go through a substantial change cycle, I start another narrative referencing the former to provide the background information and describe the desired solution our user sees. Working in this manner has made it easier to retain the big picture without writing gruelling specifications that colleagues seldom read in their totality.</p>\n<p>I've carried on happily for several years, working in this fashion. It's been an excellent vehicle for writing high-level requirements in an accessible format before working through the details with UX Designers and Engineers. However, I sometimes pitch projects to our founders in light of reoccurring feedback from customers. While these aren't entire pivots and fit our product strategy, they take our roadmap in an unexpected direction. I noted that I wasnâ€™t getting to the point quickly when communicating these opportunities upwards. After some reflection, I realised my storytelling wasn't hitting the mark. Fortunately, I watched a ProductTank talk by Harriet Patience-Davies that helped immensely.</p>\n<p>Harriet gave a fascinating talk at ProductTank in November 2021, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/yZN6IYciwU8?start=859&#x26;end=1452\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Driving a shared product vision and goal setting</a>. Her presentation on storytelling introduced me to the logline concept. In Hollywood, loglines help sell a movie within a succinate sentence giving the reader a high-level summary.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>   When &#x3C;flawed hero at start of the story> is forced to &#x3C;call to adventure>, they have to &#x3C;achieve or overcome something> or risk &#x3C;losing everything>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, she points out we could adjust this structure for a product development team to read as follows.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>   A &#x3C;company/team/product> must/needs to/wants to &#x3C;take action> to &#x3C;fix a problem/win new audience/reach objectives> or risk &#x3C;the stakes>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So why is this important? The trickiest thing about being a Product Manager is bringing everyone on the journey. The product narrative is a brilliant vehicle to communicate the ambition and relevant detail to product team members, who can then build upon this information to figure out the UI/UX and deliver working software that solves the problem definition. However, the logline format allows Product Managers to encapsulate the problem briefly and desired conclusion to capture the audience's attention. However, the people outside the product development team would gain the most from a logline format as you sell your team's solution to their problem.</p>\n"}},{"node":{"path":"/blog/acorn-i-is-a-finalist-for-amazon-ads-partner-awards-2021/","title":"Acorn-i is a finalist for Amazon Ads Partner Awards 2021","subtype":"post","figure":{"caption":"Unsplash","img":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/2021-12-14-amazon-ads-partner-awards-finalists.0b85c65.bd395378443c64f527407a8c0d3cec8e.jpg","size":{"width":1920,"height":1080},"sizes":"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px","srcset":["/assets/static/2021-12-14-amazon-ads-partner-awards-finalists.1b91758.bd395378443c64f527407a8c0d3cec8e.jpg 480w","/assets/static/2021-12-14-amazon-ads-partner-awards-finalists.3df3210.bd395378443c64f527407a8c0d3cec8e.jpg 1024w","/assets/static/2021-12-14-amazon-ads-partner-awards-finalists.0b85c65.bd395378443c64f527407a8c0d3cec8e.jpg 1920w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1920 1080' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-fdcae06fd734f044c7ae2db3b74ade81'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='40'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-fdcae06fd734f044c7ae2db3b74ade81)' width='1920' height='1080' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%2c/9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAkAEADASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGwAAAgMBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYEBQcDCAH/xAAvEAABBAECBAMHBQEAAAAAAAABAAIDBBEFIQYSEzFBUXEHFCJCYZGhMoGisdHw/8QAGgEAAgMBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQCAwYFAf/EACMRAAEEAQMEAwAAAAAAAAAAAAEAAgMRBAUSEyExQYEycaH/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AMfjrOZjmG3mpccBHZTabnAASxBzPoryvpVW2xvRmEch%2bVy0cTw3suRLimXoehS9HFI0ggKdEwvx8JV07QrUH6mcw8xuiOrJC7BiynI8to7pKbSZKsKFHTeRkN2XxsHVikIGGscWEu2GR3TTRpSSMHPHuT9gkL2k1paN%2bCjBO51e2TYMRwA15djY%2bR74PZRyNR4m7gLVUWjlzqeaUueqQzOxB8VTW4Q3OUxwQipRip3WPqWoY%2bUsn2DgPFruzh6b/RU%2boRBud91RLliRibh07iddqll4inyPdq8MAHllxP5wpVXjC3Djnq1ZCPEhzf6KWULOCRw8rQ8jrtatw37UKcb2xavphjZ26sDucD1ad/sVo%2bnQ6drlY29Mmq3oj3ED8lvqO4PqvMS70rlmhYbYo2Jq07e0kLyxw/cLwySeCmocsM%2bbQfwr0lNUETg2MOjwfmWW%2b1arbuanQY2u5xbBIeZjSfhBGc/94pdi474ojfzHWrcp8piJB/IFdr/H/EVyFkfvjYMDd1eMMc71P%2bYVRknPQ0R9pyXJwpYi3aWn0U96ZPqb6oq6vHCI2xMDOmSSCBgh2e52zn64VVq2nN5XvD2Bo3Jc4ABJknGHEUkHRfrV4x%2bXUx%2bRuq69q2oahG1l27POxvZsj8hWiWRLunxttbST6UJCEKK5yEIQhCEIQhCEIQhC/9k=' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"},"alt":"Joyful sunset","url":"https://unsplash.com/photos/hRdVSYpffas"},"publishedAt":"2021-12-14","excerpt":"I am thrilled that Acorn Intelligence is a finalist for not one but two categories for the inaugural Amazon Ads Partner Awards!

Unfortunately, in my experience, the idea of an MVP is frequently misunderstood and abused to deliver a project within a time box. After which, the product development team would pivot to another project. Not before making some very minor changes based on user feedback.</p>\n<p>Unsurprisingly, this practice produced disappointing software and frustrated customers. Therefore, an MVP has to be more than just minimal functionality to delight our customers. Ideally, after the initial release, sustained development would satisfy all the desired outcomes and polish experiences that didn't perform as expected.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>   However we choose to make an MVP, we need to make it meaningful.</p>\n<p>   <cite><a href=\"https://brianpagan.net/2015/lean-startup-mvp-how-to-make-meaningful-products/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Brian PagÃ¡n</a></cite></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Sadly, these behaviours stem from utilising an internal technology team as an onsite software agency. Furthermore, I suspect this comes from an I.T. project mentality to procure customer solutions for the current operational problems.</p>\n<p>These behaviours are the antithesis of modern software development and prevent organisations from becoming product companies. But through transparency, careful management of expectations, and autonomy, a product development team will deliver a valuable, usable, and feasible product.</p>\n<p>While the metaphors present in Henrik Kniberg's article \"<a href=\"https://blog.crisp.se/2016/01/25/henrikkniberg/making-sense-of-mvp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Making sense of MVP (Minimum Viable Product) â€“ and why I prefer Earliest Testable/Usable/Lovable</a>\" are perhaps a little confusing.

For example, redefine an existing industry, time savings or financial returns.</li>\n<li>Is it feasible, and when can it be delivered?</li>\n<li>How will the product be monetised, subscriptions or advertising?</li>\n<li>Out of all the validated ideas, what is the core functionality?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In Kniberg's article, the \"skateboard release\" is a crucial point and the first production release. Getting to this point is a big triumph and something to celebrate. But your initial version is where the real work starts. It's the point where we are collecting quantitive data from usage and qualitative feedback from customers under production conditions. That's the point of the MVP. Build enough to learn and improve. It will be emotional as we understand whether our initial version is valuable and usable. However, armed with this new information, we can start the journey of continuous discovery and iteration.</p>\n<p>Therefore, Kniberg recommends considering this initial release as your Earliest Testable Product. To that end, Product Managers should modify our language to suit the audience and carefully convey this point to suit the audience.

To close out this short essay, I'd like to leave you with a few closing thoughts which might help you in future.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Use the acronym MVP sparingly, as it's a loaded term, and be upfront with everyone about the scope.</li>\n<li>To help articulate the vision, try writing out the validated ideas as desired Outcomes or ORKs. These techniques will give further structure and allow you to easily translate them into Epics and Stories.</li>\n<li>Prioritise your Stories carefully to be lean. It may seem obvious, but prioritising the wrong items can be expensive. To avoid this common pitfall, try using the User Story Mapping technique to help confirm priorities to achieve the desired outcome and avoid confirmation bias.</li>\n<li>Find a noun appropriate for your organisation to best label the initial release. For example, Skateboard may work for you. But depending on the audience, I use \"prototype\" or simply point out that this version is our initial release.</li>\n<li>Try to be unemotional about your work and earnest that the feedback is welcome and valuable. Continuous discovery is crucial to ongoing innovation and success.</li>\n<li>Finally, attempt to quickly release minor changes discovered through customer feedback after the initial release. Doing so will generate a lot of goodwill for internal products.</li>\n</ol>\n"}},{"node":{"path":"/blog/the-path-to-becoming-a-better-product-manager/","title":"The Path to Becoming a Better Product Manager","subtype":"youtube","figure":{"caption":"YouTube","img":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/2021-06-10-the-path-to-becoming-a-better-product-manager.83f8925.dc2884f9f83cd47f693674fbd8a6d988.jpg","size":{"width":1280,"height":720},"sizes":"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px","srcset":["/assets/static/2021-06-10-the-path-to-becoming-a-better-product-manager.1b91758.dc2884f9f83cd47f693674fbd8a6d988.jpg 480w","/assets/static/2021-06-10-the-path-to-becoming-a-better-product-manager.83f8925.dc2884f9f83cd47f693674fbd8a6d988.jpg 1280w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1280 720' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-eed34f02deb0513b9b14de774407a2bd'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='40'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-eed34f02deb0513b9b14de774407a2bd)' width='1280' height='720' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%2c/9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAkAEADASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGwAAAgMBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAcDBAYFAgj/xAAzEAABAwMDAgQFAQkBAAAAAAABAgMEAAURBhIxIVEHEyJBFDJhcYHhFRcjM0KhscHS8P/EABsBAAICAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEFAgQAAwYH/8QAKxEAAAUCBAQGAwAAAAAAAAAAAAECAwQRMQUSIUEUUXGRExUiIzKxgdHw/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwB6%2bG0eUvw50otiZ5STaIgCC2FAfwU9e9Wb1fItnYU3OveHSkghpre4FfTGcfmlBpvWFynaL09bmHDCgRrYyHPKPrWlDQySrkA44Hf3rB6YsCtb2eRfLnq562y1OqEWOgelKUnA3DI9%2b1WXyKJl8bWutCpbrQwWY5PGdK9zH0rpfVdou0ZFtcnF2UsKRh9BQXASegJ5ODjua8P6ei6U03eZFqL6pDkcgrcVnaBngAe2SfxSY8PmzqDSDT0w7bnGecjqkIOPMUhXRR7/AH5pp6d8QIitMui%2bEuTWMNKbABMgHoCBx3z%2btb1NE82a41aHcutvwNakMMLS%2b6Xw58t%2b4WzUdhDStymnTnoQtQwPtipkRmFddjRHYOq/5r1LkofmlNnakxmFqwiOXN%2b0k8A9vpVQuvocIK3ErT6SCSCMe30qiqMps6KId7h%2bJx8UbN2K5mLe9S6lsLQYY27S01uA%2bbzVjP8Ab/2K5mrEMK01c/IZQhz4Z3AQ4pRI2K9iKutSnQoeYtxxPbeRWjiWpU3RupLs%2bhwMsW2UlnzF7ty/JWCR9Bkj7n6UclCqJzHuHaUtf3uF/oWYzB0vAefUEpEBoZPHyipdKPLUxPh2SBJkMNulxpuPJCNu45JKSPk3e4zjtxWM0nqF13T8NpqPEAYZaaPnSw2VekdQCOKkkXB2M6ZbERuG98pei3BAJCuhBAzkEcjHFNJsZiUnMS/VQh5xGmuR11poN5pjUEFu2LjxQGXQFK8raQd6upOfc5JJNQNYyQTyKxNtuH7NKkR4UYqKeivjE9RngdOnPvjirqdSSS8W/gowOSncZicEgZ5xV6IUaO2aSVf%2b5CnKrKbU25uG1GZk6ovMJEOAlgNpbQt1CTwnGVrVxnp0/wB02L3pm1XrKpsVJe4DyPSsfkc/nNIrTPjTcLRZY8BdhjSPIBSlw3JCcpySBjB44rqfv7m7nEq0xHQpAyQq6JGft6PrSiQla1UTYrCeFt%2bXmpxLh5lXO30N034YwUygtc%2bSuODny9qQSO279K6msVwm/D7UUSCppKGbXJSG0f0gNK4pVTPHiY/HfYTp%2bK04pGARdEnnt6ax2p/FGYqwXJldpZbD0Vxre3OCynegp4A64zSySUxK0k03mTvqRdtQ8XP4ovfctbT9EFJZLg/DtbDbQaKFoQohxpK%2buPqKsyLi7JZDS2oyEjktsJST17gUUU8SWhBCq5ipgdhRgdhRRUhEGB2FGB2FFFYMBgdhUM0D4OR0H8tX%2bDRRQVYErj//2Q==' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"},"alt":"The Path to Becoming a Better Product Manager - Petra Wille","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiTssZDbOoU"},"publishedAt":"2021-06-10","excerpt":"Really enjoyed listening to this fireside chat between Janna Bastow and Petra Wille discussing Petra's new book Strong Product People and professional growth for Product Managers.

These requests will come from managers and stakeholders who wish to track the planned outputs against deadlines or due to legacy Project Management Office behaviours.</p>\n<p>Regardless of the catalysts, these requests come from good intentions. However, your organisation will likely be too focused on shipping features and meeting arbitrary timescales to satisfy customer wants instead of solving real problems. If this sounds familiar, I recommend reading Escaping the Build Trap by Melissa Perri. This approach will likely focus on delivering features that do not meet expectations, causing dissatisfaction for customers and stakeholders.</p>\n<p>Instead, I prefer a<a href=\"https://www.prodpad.com/blog/how-to-build-a-product-roadmap-everyone-understands/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"> theme-based roadmap</a>. This roadmap style requires you to focus on customer problems we intend to solve, experiments you want to run, and the R&#x26;D for longer-term strategic bets.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>   Themes are a Promise to Solve Problems, Not Build Features.</p>\n<p>   <a href=\"https://articles.uie.com/themes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Jared M. Spool</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You then arrange these themes across different time horizons covering the Present, Near Term and Future. They're usually labelled as Now, Next and Later. Items closer to the present will be smaller, better-understood items with more explicit scope, just like your product backlog. These time horizons are the real differentiator - as traditional roadmaps list promised features arranged across a timeline with pre-agreed specifications and delivery dates.</p>\n<p>Using a theme-based roadmap allows you to reprioritise themes based on customer needs while discovering how to realise the product vision.</p>\n<h3 id=\"so-how-does-a-theme-based-roadmap-work\"><a href=\"#so-how-does-a-theme-based-roadmap-work\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>So how does a theme-based roadmap work?</h3>\n<p>Much like a backlog of user stories, you'll prioritise the opportunities and problems. Next, you'll arrange these themes over three or four columns. From left to right, they'll read Now, Next and Later.

As you move further to the right-hand side, you'll find items with more ambiguity. The Later column on my roadmap contains fluffy titles for candidate projects requiring discovery. I am currently using Now, Next, Later and Ideas. The Ideas column is a backlog for problems and new ideas to replenish our Later column periodically.</p>\n<p>However, you can adjust the labels for each time horizon to best convene the current and future work. For example, renaming Later to read H2 2021 is helpful while retraining those used to traditional timelines.</p>\n<h3 id=\"so-whats-it-like-using-a-theme-based-roadmap\"><a href=\"#so-whats-it-like-using-a-theme-based-roadmap\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>So what's it like using a theme-based roadmap?</h3>\n<p>After using this framework for the last couple of years, I learnt through experience that arranging initiatives modifies everyone's mindset when discussing our roadmap during our<a href=\"https://svpg.com/the-product-council/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"> Product Council</a> meetings. Instead of discussing the delivery of a single feature, we have conversations about our customer's problems and goals. In addition, as we release each new iteration, we collect further feedback to confirm how well we solved the problem. Our roadmap has become the communication tool that facilitates these discussions.</p>\n<p>Meeting and discussing the roadmap in this manner has forced us to prioritise these problems carefully. In turn, we've focused on the right opportunities and delighted our customers as we solve their challenges. I hope you find the above interesting and try out the format for your product.</p>\n"}},{"node":{"path":"/blog/wireframes-aren-t-just-for-designers/","title":"Wireframes Arenâ€™t Just for Designers","subtype":"post","figure":{"caption":"Unsplash","img":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/2021-05-03-wireframes-arent-just-for-designers.0b85c65.3da7c14bfcee17435014247a2e80d2c8.jpg","size":{"width":1920,"height":1080},"sizes":"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px","srcset":["/assets/static/2021-05-03-wireframes-arent-just-for-designers.1b91758.3da7c14bfcee17435014247a2e80d2c8.jpg 480w","/assets/static/2021-05-03-wireframes-arent-just-for-designers.3df3210.3da7c14bfcee17435014247a2e80d2c8.jpg 1024w","/assets/static/2021-05-03-wireframes-arent-just-for-designers.0b85c65.3da7c14bfcee17435014247a2e80d2c8.jpg 1920w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1920 1080' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-01663b741ce153241be73bf637e6bb5d'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='40'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-01663b741ce153241be73bf637e6bb5d)' width='1920' height='1080' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%2c/9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAkAEADASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAHAAAAgIDAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAwQAAgEFBwgG/8QANBAAAgEDAQUFBgUFAAAAAAAAAQIDAAQRIQUSMVFhEyJBQnEUIzJSgdEGkaHB8AckYrHx/8QAFwEAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECA//EACERAAICAQIHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAiERA9ExMkFRYaHB/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwD7O02fYbNt0NyY0ONN7i3oOJrYRQXV3pDG1rAOnvW%2bnkHU603a7GtbSQ3L7810dO2k7zKOQ5fSnoomWbtHkZ4yOPynoeXQ1KjKfPXhbm7nCFadvu/i39AVtLV7QW0kCvEPJNhgSNfNx1p63hZBv7wjXHFDgD6cKwrRlX3pVkdTu5UAvw4Yq8ayBlMgLDiFB%2bH16/pWqqkYO3llfar5biIKsD2xBLNISr9MDGNeppsXUWvaIUI4%2bNUZTLGwMjDJ8vEdMeNVS0ijYdmMPjGAcadRyoEGJhkTMZDY8PEUvNG0jRkMV7POVDHvjGNaWlVXIDx4J5Zz0obyvZiSRp39niGudd5vlH846UDGoJFljDIcqwrJZYgyxJluJ5D1%2b1cw/pT%2bNxte3Oztoy7u0Yl7zcDMg84/yHmH1rqLKVtytuB4Yx%2bp60KwawzFqoZS2SZAO8d3X8uXpTeFUKy65%2bHd/ak4pRKncO6dGO74/v8AaiqpkBZ%2b42dHBwSf540CCRuzErKjZPB1qz99AxBdR4GhS3HZOO3UhNMP1zj7dOtWklRmCxt70j6geJI5UAUIOeyh7i8WOfhHTr/2taVF9Orgf2kJ92PBz832/Oi3khnlNjATu8Z39fL6nx6U0FWNAqjAAwBSbKS6njWzu7ixvoLu0laK4hcOjrxBFetvwteS3eybeWXd3nijkwBoCy5IHSpUpQHLgNXjFLhCujMrEnOug0/3R4/fwJ2gBDhsjljlUqVZBe3ZnKIzHDFh6YxWrtpmi2FcbRUL7VIruSRoMMQAOg5cyalSgBrZcSxWq7uSW7zMTkkniTR5iQtSpUFn/9k=' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"},"alt":"Wireframe drawn ben pen","url":"https://unsplash.com/photos/4UGmm3WRUoQ"},"publishedAt":"2021-05-03","excerpt":"I was just getting started in product management, working as a junior at Ask Jeeves, when I first came across wireframes.

With a pinch of artistic flair, I found one can easily layout screen controls in<a href=\"https://balsamiq.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"> Balsamiq</a> to draw enough to show what a webpage could or should do. Just like this, article on Mind the Product says, \"<a href=\"https://www.mindtheproduct.com/wireframes-arent-just-for-designers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Wireframes Arenâ€™t Just for Designers</a>\". They're a thinking and communication tool for Product Managers.</p>\n<p>They're a great way to help form your ideas while ideating. Using Balsamiq or pen and paper will allow you to assess a hypothesis further, fail quickly and learn more by clicking through the initial concepts with colleagues. Be careful, as it's easy to become preoccupied with finding this solution. However, it's always important to remember there is a team around you to help you do the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>   The role of a product manager is to discover a product that is valuable, usable, and feasible.</p>\n<p>   <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0981690408/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Inspired: How to Create Products Customers Love by Marty Cagan</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Your wireframes will be a helpful communication tool to share the ideas you've distilled with your teammates during a discovery meeting. Similar to a storyboard used in film and television to convey the protagonist's journey. Ideally, the team's designer will revise your rough concept and produce a Hi-Fi, clickable prototype. Next, you should validate these ideas with your stakeholders. Or, better still, perform some initial user testing to validate the concept further. Ultimately your initial wireframes, you should be able to learn:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Has the team discovered a solution to the customer's problem?</li>\n<li>Can this be built?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I hope you give it a try.</p>\n"}},{"node":{"path":"/blog/working-backwards-from-a-fake-press-release/","title":"Working Backwards From A Fake Press Release","subtype":"post","figure":{"caption":"Unsplash","img":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/2021-04-23-working-backwards-from-a-fake-press-release.0b85c65.0c0a26e2d76ff4c92d858473faf4f283.jpg","size":{"width":1920,"height":1080},"sizes":"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px","srcset":["/assets/static/2021-04-23-working-backwards-from-a-fake-press-release.1b91758.0c0a26e2d76ff4c92d858473faf4f283.jpg 480w","/assets/static/2021-04-23-working-backwards-from-a-fake-press-release.3df3210.0c0a26e2d76ff4c92d858473faf4f283.jpg 1024w","/assets/static/2021-04-23-working-backwards-from-a-fake-press-release.0b85c65.0c0a26e2d76ff4c92d858473faf4f283.jpg 1920w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 1920 1080' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-d0aa8538ff3c53f61d70119275d07566'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='40'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-d0aa8538ff3c53f61d70119275d07566)' width='1920' height='1080' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%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%2bGbCU%2b6SzXLd4zgEkeOP00wx8JbuRlII5B%2bCQaJbdwrulJlLoJMfckyP76cKBalVeS2DDHEpd3c4CqBkk/TUin9KlOsEo3mG7szCC5VERkUsrMAW6HHQ9RrltiLZkRv2maSIjJSWBFPxHgdBO0/tFimrcP2r9cwm9DPYhVSCRAZOWPm6%2bJC5z8dBeEeP9ukv1ksSvhnVD7Hj103pSD7vA9y1K7u38PEVz0BUHQS3efbLxGypFVsKpD2EQc658lOOh%2bOr5JS2%2bf8AmVoDn1QaH2ODeH7JYvtkIZjklMqT%2bR0dLL3F9Qn9jl9bPBFRQ2e6Z0Hyzp/jkOoR2Hz2KduzUV2ej3HeAMfcPNgdfz1ZEuoVY8wVVGSW6DHrny10R5RhJUwvLZirV5J7EiRQxqXeRzgKo8ST6amXbNxXTm4cg2bb76ynd5RDYkrHvDFXA5pD082GFH9R9NK/arxJuXEVZKfDSWLG0REm1LHhEssPBVLHLKMeQwT8tRpXqXXeai8tHc4SEMTqBHI33WGfZJ8M%2bGcfPRctOBRjeS93NqpcdcP7fuO17At6jSJrClYIjdUAGOQj6fprvwfsnZzT3JY22WvtG8IQe53BMMp8uVmOP8aXvs/3JJeJJi8U%2bWpsSOc4T2gCCvmc9P8Ajqp7vap77LPSr1K24MoMUztjuofg0o6lvwJ19SNGLtcimknwOUQUKMYIx0OumRqNvwnxpwxK83CXEENqtkt%2b7ri4UD0U9R/qfidDL3bTvWzZpb5wm9fdV8FLuEk8vZAVifoTqWGvwD9llt4FroipiZuR8jxAzjTVxfus8ME1QJE0Ei8rq655gfEHrra2nHqSXYWbkrz0VDnAcYwvTl6HqvpjGo3xORBuO030Ve%2buxlbC49mQc2Oo%2bOtraykOJdPs80q9mxxAbCNI9V0roxdslDkkNg4Pujx9NWmvtdWpCkcUYAQYBwAcfTA1tbUWCpZPHcKSTlvlnprg6hmwwB5fA%2bmtratAP//Z' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"},"alt":"Designed sketching wireframes","url":"https://unsplash.com/photos/s9CC2SKySJM"},"publishedAt":"2021-04-23","excerpt":"I've recently become involved with figuring out the vision for a significant new product capability.

This idea has excited many colleagues with the possibilities of our successful experiment. However, as there are many competing ideas and overlapping viewpoints, it's become evident that arriving early at a conscious will be crucial.</p>\n<p>To help find an acceptable middle ground for everyone, I decided to try a different technique and confirm our ideas, creating a shared understanding. I wrote a fake press release to describe what we'd like to announce at the launch. Initially, this was a slightly daunting task, but after reading <a href=\"https://mattyford.com/blog/2014/3/12/working-backwards-press-release-a-product-development-framework\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Matty Ford's blog post from 2014</a>, I found the concept of working backwards very straightforward. The provided template helped me capture the essential information and organise my thoughts. I was also encouraged to try the technique after learning it's been tried and tested by Amazon.</p>\n<p>I found the concept of working backwards really helpful and recommend experimenting with it yourselves. It cut downs the waffle and focused on what was important to share with the reader. Where we find agreement, we'll have a shared vision which will become our Minimal-Viable-Product or <a href=\"https://blog.crisp.se/2016/01/25/henrikkniberg/making-sense-of-mvp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Skateboard Version</a>.</p>\n<p>Where your stakeholders and development team find unacceptable gaps, you should thoroughly discuss those concerns. The benefit of a fake press release is you can iterate on content with your stakeholders until you find a shared agreement. This experience allowed us to focus on the intended destination upfront. From there, we began working backwards a la Amazon. Similarly, you could go through the same process of trimming the fat to find a lean deliverable.</p>\n<p>I hope you experiment with this idea for yourself and find it helpful.</p>\n"}}]}},"context":{}}
