With a bit of artistic flair, I found one can easily layout screen controls in <a href=\"https://balsamiq.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Balsamiq</a> to draw enough to show what a webpage could or should do. Just like this 'Mind the Product' article says, \"<a href=\"https://www.mindtheproduct.com/wireframes-arent-just-for-designers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Wireframes Aren’t Just for Designers</a>\". They're a thinking and communication tool for Product Managers.</p>\n<p>I am positive they're a great way to help form your ideas when you're while ideating. If you're prepared to use Balsamiq or pen and paper, they'll provide you with the agility to further assess a hypothesis, fail quickly and learn more. It's easy to become preoccupied with find this solution. However, it's always important to remember there is a team around you to help you do the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The role of a product manager is to discover a product that is valuable, usable, and feasible.</p>\n<p><cite><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0981690408/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Inspired: How to Create Products Customers Love by Marty Cagan</a></cite></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Your wireframes will be a helpful communication tool to share the ideas you've distilled with your teammates during a discovery meeting. Similar to a storyboard used in film and television to convey the protagonist's journey. Ideally, the team's designer will revise your concept and produce a Hi-Fi clickable prototype. Next, you should validate these ideas with your stakeholders. Or, better still, perform some initial user testing. Ultimately your initial wireframes, you should be able to learn:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Has the team discovered a solution to the customer's problem?</li>\n<li>Can this be built?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I hope you give it a try.</p>\n"}},"context":{}}
