While at[ Loughborough University](https://www.lboro.ac.uk/), I read[ Computing and Management BSc](https://www.lboro.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/courses/a-z/computing-and-management-bsc/). The goal was to give students a well-balanced education of hybrid skills, covering Computer Science courses with additional modules for management, psychology, and marketing. I took the four-year variant with an Industrial Placement. I was employed as a Web Developer by[ Andalucia.com](https://www.andalucia.com/) and relocated to the south of Spain.
