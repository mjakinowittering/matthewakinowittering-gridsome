While at[ Loughborough University](https://www.lboro.ac.uk/), I read[ their Computing and Management BSc](https://www.lboro.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/courses/a-z/computing-and-management-bsc/) degree and received a well-balanced education in programming, database, human-computer interaction and operating systems from the Computer Science School with management, finance, psychology, and marketing classes from the Business School.
