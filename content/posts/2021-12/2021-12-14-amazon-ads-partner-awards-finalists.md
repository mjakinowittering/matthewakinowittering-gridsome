I am thrilled that [Acorn Intelligence](https://www.acorn-i.com) is a finalist for not one, but two categories for the inaugural [Amazon Ads Partner Awards](https://advertising.amazon.com/en-us/blog/uk-partner-awards-finalists)! We made it to the final three in Innovation Award and Scaled Technology Award categories. As the Lead Product Manager for [Ignite by Acorn-i](https://acorn-i.com/ignite-by-acorn-i/), it is incredible that we've reached the final three for the Scaled Technology awards, along with [Amerge](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6877605664840011776/) and [Pacvue](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6876942476091895808/).

The Scaled Technology award honours a trailblazing Amazon Ads partner who is integrated with the [Amazon Ads API](https://advertising.amazon.com/about-api) and has developed a technology application that has helped their UK clients expand their business to new regions over the past year. In addition, finalists have effectively leveraged Amazon Ads products to drive global growth for their clients.
