I have found listening to Roman Pichler's book "[How to Lead in Product Management](https://www.audible.co.uk/pd/How-to-Lead-in-Product-Management-Audiobook/B08FCWFLZM)" a great help. From my perspective, the vast majority of books and training materials for frameworks used by product management and, therefore, too focused on the product vision, discovery, requirements, planning and execution.

Fortunately, Roman's recent book is one of an ever-increasing number of texts on product leadership and professional growth. I listened to his book on Audible and was glad it covers what I feel is nearly universally assumed, every product practitioner is already a fantastic communicator, equipped with the necessary armour to receive difficult feedback during challenging conversations.

Roman provides plenty of helpful techniques with examples to highlight why listening deeply with empathy is crucial to collaborate effectively to develop the necessary trust for product leadership. Try a few episodes of [Roman's Product Podcast](https://www.romanpichler.com/podcast/) if youâ€™re still in doubt.
