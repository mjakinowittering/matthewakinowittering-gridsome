I've recently spent a lot of time thinking about communication between product managers, customers, stakeholders and leaders. I've spent time dwelling on this topic because there is a vast gulf in expectations between all parties.

In my 12 years in Product Management, it's never been easier to learn from peers and thought leaders the behaviours and techniques that should be present in your product management toolkit. Unfortunately, despite the wealth of helpful content covering anecdotes, case studies and theory, it's tantamount to navel-gazing. So to help me ponder a few topics, such as communication, I'm writing and sharing my thoughts to offer insights into the product management craft in the hope it provides valuable insights to a broader audience.

>    Customers want outputs. Product Managers want outcomes.

The statement above, of variations on the theme, gets bounded about regularly and may seem counter-intuitive as product managers work with colleagues trained to design and build software to produce new or improved artefacts for our customers.

In contrast, the role of a product manager is to provide information that ensures the development team discovers valuable and usable solutions to customer problems. The engineering talent will ensure that their solution is both feasible and reliable.

That said, the team's output won't always be new software. Instead, it could be better documentation, scaling to improve stability or fixing bugs. Unfortunately, where an output-focused culture prevails, product development teams are only "Building for the Sake of Building". Melissa Perri calls this situation [The Build Trap](https://melissaperri.com/blog/2014/08/05/the-build-trap).

Melissa's book is worth reading to learn about the various hallmarks of organisations and teams stuck in this rut. In short, software teams in this situation produce software with diminished usefulness and overall quality that lacks a certain 'je ne sais quoi' as they aren't solving 'real' problems that create positive change for their customers. Instead, their work might result from ill-thought-out pet projects of senior leaders, poorly understood issues plaguing customers or, worst still, features written into contracts by sales teams to win the sale. What a nightmare. So what's the solution?
