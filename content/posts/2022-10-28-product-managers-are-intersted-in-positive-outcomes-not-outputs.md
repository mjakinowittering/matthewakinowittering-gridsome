I've recently spent a lot of time thinking about communication between product managers, customers, stakeholders and leaders. I've spent time dwelling on this topic because there is a vast gulf in expectations between all parties.

In my 12 years in Product Management, it's never been easier to learn from peers and thought leaders the behaviours and techniques that should be present in your product management toolkit. Unfortunately, despite the wealth of helpful content covering anecdotes, case studies and theory, it's tantamount to navel-gazing.

So to help me ponder a few topics, such as communication and empathy, I'm writing here to share my thoughts and offer insights into the product management craft in the hope it provides valuable insights to a broader audience. Unfortunately, product management regularly gets distilled into this combative quip.

>    Customers want outputs. Product Managers want outcomes.

The statement above, of variations on the theme, gets bounded about and may seem counter-intuitive as product managers work with colleagues trained to design and build software to produce new or improved artefacts for our customers. In contrast, the role of a product manager is to provide information that ensures their team discovers valuable and usable solutions to customer problems - a process called Product Discovery. Something not regularly discussed outside of product circles. Finally, it's the responsibility of the team's engineering talent will ensure that their solution is feasible and reliable.

[Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDqQcmVqAm4) has a fantastic description of taking ideas, comments and feedback through a process where a team has the space to explore and polish those initial thoughts to become Usable, Value and Feasible products.

That said, the team's output won't always be new software. Instead, it could be better documentation, scaling to improve stability or fixing bugs. Unfortunately, where an output-focused culture prevails, product development teams are only "Building for the Sake of Building". Melissa Perri calls this situation [The Build Trap](https://melissaperri.com/blog/2014/08/05/the-build-trap).

Melissa's book is worth reading to learn about the various hallmarks of organisations and teams stuck in this rut. In short, software teams in this situation produce software with diminished usefulness and overall quality that lacks a certain 'je ne sais quoi' as they aren't solving 'real' problems that create positive change for their customers. Instead, their work might result from ill-thought-out pet projects of senior leaders, poorly understood issues plaguing customers or, worst still, features written into contracts by sales teams to win the sale. What a nightmare! So what's the solution?

There isn't a silver bullet to say or framework to adopt that will solve this problem. But, product managers can minimise tensions for their customers, stakeholders and leaders by approaching these conversations with empathy and transparency to explain how ideas move to Product Discovery. Furthermore, only some ideas will move on to Product Delivery and the reasons.

Finally, we all need to remember you all want a positive result, but it takes hard work to get on the same page.
