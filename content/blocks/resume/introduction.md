I am a Product Manager with 14 years of experience across B2B and B2C businesses. I enjoy teamwork, meeting customers and building 0-1 products and capabilities to support them. I’m comfortable working as either an individual contributor or leading colleagues as they work to support alarger company vision. I enjoy working with commercial and operational team stakeholders and my product and engineering teammates to realise the desired outcome. I’m proud to have contributed to the technology assets of two businesses, both acquired for their technology assets, one Scale-Up and the second a Start-Up.
