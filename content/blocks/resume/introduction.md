I am a Product Manager with 14 years of experience across B2B and B2C businesses. I enjoy teamwork, meeting customers and building products to support them. I enjoy and excel as either an individual contributor or leading colleagues as they work to support a larger company vision. Iâ€™m proud to have contributed to the technology assets of two businesses, one Scale-Up and the second a Start-Up, both acquired for their technology.
