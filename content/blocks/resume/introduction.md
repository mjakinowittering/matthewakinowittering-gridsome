I am a Technical Product Lead with over 13 years of experience employed by Acorn-i, an Advertising and eCommerce Agency. I am responsible for our SaaS analytics platform, Ignite. I am also Dyslexic, and I credit my ‘[dyslexic thinking](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/dyslexic-thinking)’ too many of my successes by helping me spot patterns, analyse data, simplify information, think laterally, and build empathy.

I am passionate about Product Management, and I regularly read books and attend meetups to learn from the community. I’ve also completed the [Product-led Certification](https://www.credly.com/badges/7c1b8816-d6d1-488f-820e-d42aa810df9d/public_url) by Pendo and Mind the Product. In addition, I’m a hobbyist programmer, tinkering with software projects in the interest of lifelong learning. My successes include a personal [website](https://matthew.akinowittering.com/) hosted on GitHub Pages, where I occasionally Blog about Product Management and a self-published [Python](https://github.com/mjakinowittering/pistachio) package on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/user/mjakinowittering/).
