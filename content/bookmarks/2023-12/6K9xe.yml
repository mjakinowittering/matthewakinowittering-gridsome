  ogDescription: >-
    Great corporate cultures are not just good for performance, but for the
    flourishing and engagement of the people who work in them and to deliver
    greater meaning and purpose. But oft overlooked is the central role that
    curiosity plays in crafting an organizational culture. To unlock the
    potential of their institutions and the people within them, great leaders
    need to demonstrate consistent curiosity in four key areas. First, they must
    be curious about the values and motivations of their employees in shaping
    and maintaining a corporate culture. Second, curiosity must be extended to
    customers to find out not just about your products and services but about
    “why” your customers love your organization. Third, leaders must reflect
    with open-mindedness and curiosity on their own roles, especially as they
    change. Finally, leaders must stay curious about the changing nature of
    their companies and contexts over time, and adjust their cultures
    accordingly.
