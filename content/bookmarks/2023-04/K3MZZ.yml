  ogTitle: 'TBM 208: "Do You Have Specific Examples?"'
  ogDescription: >-
    "Do you have any specific examples?" The question can be both helpful and
    triggering. Consider two examples: Performance Feedback: You're in a
    performance review situation, and your manager makes a broad statement like,
    "You need to slow down to bring other people along on the journey!" What do
    you do? Your chest tenses up, and you feel threatened. The broad, sweeping
    statement cuts deep. You ask, "Could you give me an example so I could
    better understand?"
