  ogTitle: Why Product Management is Hard - A Tale of Two Pities
  ogDescription: >-
    I have given a few talks where I describe product management as (despite
    what some commentators might have you believe) a “uniquely hard job”. This
    might not be a fashionable opinion after the (much misunderstood) AirBnB
    repurposing of the PM role, but I stand behind the assertion.
