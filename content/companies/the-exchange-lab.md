The Exchange Lab was an independent programmatic advertising agency that developed its only proprietary technology, Proteus, to help and support our advertising operations across various platforms. As a member of the Product Management practice, I lead my assigned Product Development team contributing to the design and development of solutions that drove our reporting platform. WWP acquired the Exchange Lab in December 2015.
