introduction: The Exchange Lab was a small programmatic advertising agency that specialised in a platform-agnostic approach to buying display advertising. While at TEL, I contributed to various product areas as I rotated across squads delivering our proprietary technology, Proteus. TEL was acquired by WPP, on behalf of GroupM in December 2015.
