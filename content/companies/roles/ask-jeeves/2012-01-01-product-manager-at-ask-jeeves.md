After being promoted, my responsibilities in the SEO Group focused on product growth for senior stakeholders at Ask.com and About.com. Due to algorithm changes by Google Panda to penalise large content sites â€“ it was necessary to be more scientific to identify potential problem areas ahead of time and protect advertisement yields.

To that end, I spent much of my time on investigative work to identify poorer content. I largely achieved this by using Data Science tools for Natural Language Processing and reviewing website traffic. The goal was to detect and modify over-optimised content pages or unsatisfactory content. The results of this ongoing analysis highlighted poorly structured pages requiring revision by Content Managers and poorer user experiences. We tackled these pragmatically and reinvented the product over several design sprints.
