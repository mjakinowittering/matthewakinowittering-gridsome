Ask Jeevesâ€™ mission was to answer the questions of their users. To provide great answers to common questions, original content was created and hosted on several Q&A answer microsites. These websites formed part of the wider product and marketing strategy to create unique content which was Search Engine Optimised and discoverable by other platforms. This was achieved by reviewing popular searches classified as questions and outsourcing the creation of appropriate answers to publish new Q&A content. These sites were monetised by Google Ads. I reported on the current ad revenue, page views, popular topics and other visitor measurements to stakeholders.
