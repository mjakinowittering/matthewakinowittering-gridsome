Ask Jeevesâ€™ mission was to answer the questions of their users. The company had a strategy to produce content and provide answers to common questions published on several Q&A answer microsites. These websites formed part of the broader SEO strategy to create unique content discovered through other search engines and drive traffic into our platform. We achieved this by reviewing popular searches classified as questions and outsourcing the creation of appropriate answers to publish new Q&A content and monetising them with Google Ads. I reported the current ad revenue, page views, popular topics and other visitor measurements to stakeholders and identified new content niches for development.
