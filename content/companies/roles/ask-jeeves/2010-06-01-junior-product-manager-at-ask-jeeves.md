I worked with design, engineering and content management peers to build several content farms using our data to generate millions of question-and-answer pairs for our SEO strategy. We monetised these websites with advertising and had \$2,500,000 in annual recurring revenue from the UK and EU. I reported the current ad revenue, page views, popular topics and other visitor measurements to stakeholders and identified new content niches for development using our data.
