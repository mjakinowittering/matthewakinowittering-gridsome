I joined the European Teams at Ask.com, where I initially worked on search quality and competitor research projects across several Q&A websites. After a company pivot, I began working on products supporting our SEO strategy, building sites to host millions of question-and-answer pairs generated using data from our query logs. My role was to work with design, engineering and content management peers to build several content farms. We monetised these websites with advertising and had $2,500,000 in annual recurring revenue from the UK and EU. I regularly reported the current ad revenue, page views, popular topics and other visitor measurements to stakeholders and identified new content niches for development using our data.
