As the Technical Product Lead, I am responsible for our Product Management processes and Ignite. I work with our CTO, Cofounders, SaaS Customers and Client Services team to synthesise our product strategy and roadmap from their feedback. Our processes allow me to prioritise the desired outcomes that will delight our customers and work through these themes with UX, Engineering and Quality Assurance colleges to realise a suitable solution. Depending on the project scope, I collaborate with my peers across our data collection and machine learning applications.

Customers using Ignite range from Brand owners, Agencies and Holding Groups to solve recurring problems linked to data collection, cleaning and visualisation task and delay people from monitoring their eCommerce business, Customer Lifetime Value & retention, stock forecasting & replenishing, and optimising performance marketing. We've solved these problems by building software that eliminates repetitive data-intensive tasks with automation and machine learning.

Ignite provides its users with a consolidated view of their revenue from Amazon, Rakuten, Shopify, Takealot, Walmart & WooCommerce sites, along with their advertising purchased via Amazon, Facebook, Google and TikTok.
