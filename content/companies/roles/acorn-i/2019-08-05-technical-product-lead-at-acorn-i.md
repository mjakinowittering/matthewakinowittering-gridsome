Acorn Intelligence is an Agency specialising in Amazon Advertising and eCommerce. [The Brandtech Group acquired Acorn-i in June 2022](https://thebrandtechgroup.com/pr/the-brandtech-group-acquires-leading-e-commerce-tech-platform-acorn-i.html) for our Omnichannel technology platform called Ignite by Acorn-i. Ignite is used by agencies and brands to answer common operational and analytics questions concerning retail performance, stock forecasting, advertising investments and customer lifetime value.

As the Technical Product Lead, I am responsible for our Product Management processes and Ignite. I work with our CTO, Cofounders, SaaS Customers and Client Services team to consolidate our business strategy and user feedback to shape our product strategy and roadmap. Our processes allow me to prioritise outcomes for our customers. I then work through these themes with UX, Engineering and Quality Assurance colleges to realise a suitable solution. Depending upon the project scope, I collaborate with peers responsible for data collection and machine learning applications to deliver the desired change.

Ignite provides its users with a consolidated view of their sales revenue from Amazon, Rakuten, Shopify, Takealot, Walmart & WooCommerce sites. Additionally, our platform can consolidate media investments for display, search and social via Amazon, Facebook, Google and TikTok. We achieve all this by utilising the Serverless framework, AWS Lambda, S3, Athena, SQS and SageMaker, the Snowflake cloud data warehouse and Angular web framework.
