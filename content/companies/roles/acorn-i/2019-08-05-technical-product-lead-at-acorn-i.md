[Acorn Intelligence](https://acorn-i.com) is an Agency specialising in Amazon Advertising and eCommerce, a space commonly referred to as Retail Media. [The Brandtech Group acquired Acorn-i in June 2022](https://thebrandtechgroup.com/pr/the-brandtech-group-acquires-leading-e-commerce-tech-platform-acorn-i.html) for our Omnichannel technology platform called [Ignite by Acorn-i](https://ignite.acorn-i.com). Ignite is used by agencies and brands to solve common problems by providing its users with a comprehensive suite of eCommerce reports, customer lifetime value measurement, stock forecasting, and automatic optimisation of retail media investments. We've solved these problems and many more by building software that eliminates repetitive data-intensive tasks with automation and machine learning.

As the Technical Product Lead, I am responsible for our Product Management processes and Ignite. I work with our CTO, Cofounders, SaaS Customers and Client Services team to consolidate our business strategy and user feedback to form our product strategy and roadmap. Our processes allow me to prioritise the desired outcomes that will delight our customers and work through these themes with UX, Engineering and Quality Assurance colleges to realise a suitable solution. Depending upon the project scope, I collaborate with my peers working across our data collection and machine learning applications.

Ignite provides its users with a consolidated view of their revenue from Amazon, Rakuten, Shopify, Takealot, Walmart & WooCommerce sites, along with their advertising purchased via Amazon, Facebook, Google and TikTok.
