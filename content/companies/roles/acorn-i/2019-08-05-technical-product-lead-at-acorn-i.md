As the first product hire and Lead Product Manager at [Acorn-i](https://acorn-i.com/), I was excited to join and help build a modern Advertising and eCommerce Agency backed by technology. I set up our product management processes to discover and deliver solutions for our Analytics platform, [Ignite](https://ignite.acorn-i.com/). It’s since grown to include advanced Advertising automation, which utilises machine learning technologies.

To help organise how we’d prioritise opportunities, I set up a Now, Next, Later approach for roadmaps to communicate and discuss our prioritised experiments and outcomes. I report to our CTO and work closely with peers, Co-Founders and Customers to ensure I continually learn about our market and potential opportunities from our data and user feedback. Where these align with our vision and product strategy, I work to discover viable solutions we can implement to improve productivity.

We outsourced our software delivery to [TechMagic](https://www.techmagic.co/) in Ukraine. I am responsible for the day-to-day relationship management, chairing our daily stand-up, refinement and sprint planning meetings to collaborate with our design, engineering, machine learning and quality assurance practitioners. I use servant leadership principles when guiding our team about the market needs and providing written narratives, user stories, and other artefacts to empower them with the information necessary to realise the desired outcomes for our customers. Lastly, I am responsible for maintaining our external help documentation and running onboarding sessions to train new Ignite users around the globe.

All our combined hard work culminated in [The Brandtech ](https://thebrandtechgroup.com/the-brandtech-group-acquires-leading-e-commerce-tech-platform-acorn-i/)Group's acquisition of Acorn-i for our technology in June 2022. Acorn-i has licensed Ignite to customers in the UK, Europe, United States, South Africa and Japan.
