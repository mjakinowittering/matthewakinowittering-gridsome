I was the Lead Product Manager for the Vendor Integrations team in the Product and Engineering department. Together we developed software to retrieve and process data from our AdTech partners. The team and I were responsible for a portfolio of three products:

1. Vendor Integration Engine, a highly scaled data collection engine.
2. Data Lake, for conforming event-level advertising data required by our data warehouse.
3. Entity Store, for normalising campaign setup metadata used by dashboards.

At the time, our system typically processed seven to ten terabytes of new data daily. To do so, we utilised AWS EC2, S3, EMR and Elasticsearch. In addition, there was a small React web app to administer the application and Grafana dashboards for monitoring.

I produced stories and technical documentation to share information with the engineering team. Typically this included details from API documentation supplied by our vendors or definitions for their custom data feeds. During Feature Kick-off meetings, I presented these new requirements to the team and solicited feedback to realise the complete solution based on their expertise. The new item would be added to our Kanban board when requirements were certain.
