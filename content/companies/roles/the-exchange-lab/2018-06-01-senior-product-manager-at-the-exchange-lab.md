In my final 14 months at The Exchange Lab, I became the Senior Product Manager for the Vendor Integration team. I received the promotion because I became responsible for a Junior Product Manager, and our team actively managed a portfolio of applications that were responsible for moving between seven to ten terabytes of data daily, fueling campaign reporting and analytics workflows for our global customers.

Secondly, the organisation had begun collaborating with other GroupM agency teams that were deeply impressed with our bulk data collection and processing capabilities but wished to retain their brand identity in client reporting. I was increasingly involved in stakeholder management and delivering the technology needed to publish data for Client Data Lakes to facilitate the needs of their Data Analysts.
