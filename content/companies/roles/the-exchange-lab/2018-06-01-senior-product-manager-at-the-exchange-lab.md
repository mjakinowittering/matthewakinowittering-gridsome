I was the Senior Product Manager for the Vendor Integrations team in the Product and Engineering department developing software to retrieve and process data from our AdTech partners. The team and I were responsible for a portfolio of three products for performing our data collection and ingesting several terabytes of data from APIs, streams and flat files daily.

I produced stories and technical documentation to share information with the engineering team. Typically, this included details from API documentation supplied by our vendors or definitions for their custom data feeds. During Feature Kick-off meetings, I presented these new requirements and solicited feedback to refine our solution based on their expertise.

I was promoted in 2018 to reflect the change in my responsibilities, as I’d become responsible for a Junior Product Manager who’d joined the Vendor Integration team.
