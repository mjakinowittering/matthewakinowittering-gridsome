While working as a Product Manager at The Exchange Lab, my role had two distinct phases, before and after our acquisition.

Post-acquisition, we redefined our product vision for WWP, and Proteus became the single point of data collection and reporting for programmatic advertising. This vision required us to reinvent our data collection and reporting capabilities to meet these needs. I became the Product Owner for the newly formed Vendor Integration Engine team. Our team reimagined our capabilities to meet the data collection requirements and scale to support a Global Media Agency Group. This work frequently required me to collaborate with our groupâ€™s AdTech providers to create custom data feeds or use their APIs to retrieve the desired datasets.

Pre-acquisition, I regularly moved between initiatives to enhance our data management capabilities and industrialise error-prone manual activities.
