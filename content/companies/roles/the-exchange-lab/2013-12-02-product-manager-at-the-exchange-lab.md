While working as a Product Manager at The Exchange Lab, my role had two distinct phases, before and after our acquisition.

Post-acquisition, we refined our product vision for GroupM, and Proteus became the single point of data collection and reporting for programmatic advertising. This vision required us to reinvent our data collection and reporting capabilities to meet these needs. I became the Product Owner for the newly formed Vendor Integration Engine team. The team and I built the functionality necessary to meet the data collection requirements and scale to support a worldwide media agency group. I collaborated with external providers to create custom data feeds or utilised public APIs to retrieve the desired datasets. Once the integrations became possible, we refined the details as “three-amigos” before formally kicking off the development. We built a scaled platform that collected data from thousands of data sources to support hundreds of customers globally.

Pre-acquisition, I worked in the same capacity but regularly moved between initiatives to enhance data management and industrialise error-prone manual activities. I collaborated with development teams on greenfield projects covering the following topics:

1. Creative Management. To bulk upload advertisements into multiple AdTech systems simultaneously.
2. Campaign Management. It was a media planning and automation tool to create advertising campaigns across several AdTech platforms to speed up everyday setup tasks.
3. Inventory Management R&D. Was a prototype for blocking websites with non-brand-safe content.
