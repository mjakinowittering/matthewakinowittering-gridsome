In 2015, WPP acquired The Exchange Lab for our technology platform [Proteus](https://www.wpp.com/news/2015/12/groupm-acquires-programmatic-marketing-solutions-company-the-exchange-lab), an Analytics and Automation platform for Programmatic Advertising. Our new parent company, GroupM, charged us with rolling out our technology across the Agency Group. This vision required us to reinvent our data collection and reporting capabilities to meet these needs at a previously unimagined scale.

Post-acquisition, I became the Product Manager for the newly formed Vendor Integration Engine team, rebuilding our data collection capabilities to meet the scale of a Global Media Agency Group. I then worked with internal Stakeholders and our AdTech partners to ensure we could retrieve data from their platforms in the desired format, frequency and quality. The team and I used Kanban to address new capabilities and scaling challenges pragmatically.

I produced user stories and technical documentation to share the required information. Typically, this included details from API documentation supplied by our vendors or definitions for their custom data feeds. Our team used the ‘Three Amigos’ process, where I, the Product Owner, would present the new requirements to our team’s Engineering and QA Leads and clarify the scope based on their experience.

Pre-acquisition, I regularly moved between initiatives to enhance our campaign management capabilities and industrialise error-prone manual activities.
