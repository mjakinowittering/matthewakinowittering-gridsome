While studying at [Loughborough University](https://www.lboro.ac.uk/), I participated in the [Industrial Placement](https://www.lboro.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/courses/computing-and-management-bsc/#placement-year) programme. I did this at Andalucia.com, operating from the Costa del Sol. My responsibilities at Andalucia.com included constructing and modifying client websites for sister company [Andalucia Web Solutions](https://andaluciaws.com/), updating content on [Andalucia.com](http://andalucia.com/), and trafficked advertisements to the same site. Andalucia.com is an information portal publishing information for tourists and expatriates in the south of Spain. The company has operated the website since 1996.
