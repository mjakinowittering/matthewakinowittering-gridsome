</p><div class="content" data-v-41999ea2><p>As the first product hire and Lead Product Manager at <a href="https://acorn-i.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Acorn-i</a>, I was excited to join and help build a modern Advertising and eCommerce Agency backed by technology. I set up our product management processes to discover and deliver solutions for our Analytics platform, <a href="https://ignite.acorn-i.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Ignite</a>. It’s since grown to include advanced Advertising automation, which utilises machine learning technologies.</p>
<p>To help organise how we’d prioritise opportunities, I set up a Now, Next, Later approach for roadmaps to communicate and discuss our prioritised experiments and outcomes. I report to our CTO and work closely with peers, Co-Founders and Customers to ensure I continually learn about our market and potential opportunities from our data and user feedback. Where these align with our vision and product strategy, I work to discover viable solutions we can implement to improve productivity.</p>
<p>We outsourced our software delivery to <a href="https://www.techmagic.co/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">TechMagic</a> in Ukraine. I am responsible for the day-to-day relationship management, chairing our daily stand-up, refinement and sprint planning meetings to collaborate with our design, engineering, machine learning and quality assurance practitioners. I use servant leadership principles when guiding our team about the market needs and providing written narratives, user stories, and other artefacts to empower them with the information necessary to realise the desired outcomes for our customers. Lastly, I am responsible for maintaining our external help documentation and running onboarding sessions to train new Ignite users around the globe.</p>
<p>All our combined hard work culminated in <a href="https://thebrandtechgroup.com/the-brandtech-group-acquires-leading-e-commerce-tech-platform-acorn-i/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">The Brandtech </a>Group's acquisition of Acorn-i for our technology in June 2022. Acorn-i has licensed Ignite to customers in the UK, Europe, United States, South Africa and Japan.</p>

<p>Secondly, the organisation had begun collaborating with other GroupM agency teams that were deeply impressed with our bulk data collection and processing capabilities but wished to retain their brand identity in client reporting.

Our new parent company, GroupM, charged us with rolling out our technology across the Agency Group. This vision required us to reinvent our data collection and reporting capabilities to meet these needs at a previously unimagined scale.</p>
<p>Post-acquisition, I became the Product Manager for the newly formed Vendor Integration Engine team, rebuilding our data collection capabilities to meet the scale of a Global Media Agency Group. I then worked with internal Stakeholders and our AdTech partners to ensure we could retrieve data from their platforms in the desired format, frequency and quality. The team and I used Kanban to address new capabilities and scaling challenges pragmatically.</p>
<p>I produced user stories and technical documentation to share the required information. Typically, this included details from API documentation supplied by our vendors or definitions for their custom data feeds. Our team used the ‘Three Amigos’ process, where I, the Product Owner, would present the new requirements to our team’s Engineering and QA Leads and clarify the scope based on their experience.</p>
<p>Pre-acquisition, I regularly moved between initiatives to enhance our campaign management capabilities and industrialise error-prone manual activities.</p>
