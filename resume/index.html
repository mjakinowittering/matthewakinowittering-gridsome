Together we developed software to retrieve and process data from our AdTech partners. The team and I were responsible for a portfolio of three products:</p>
<ol>
<li>Vendor Integration Engine, a highly scaled data collection engine.</li>
<li>Data Lake, for conforming event-level advertising data required by our data warehouse.</li>
<li>Entity Store, for normalising campaign setup metadata used by dashboards.</li>
</ol>
<p>At the time, our system typically processed seven to ten terabytes of new data daily. To do so, we utilised AWS EC2, S3, EMR and Elasticsearch. In addition, there was a small React web app to administer the application and Grafana dashboards for monitoring.</p>
<p>I produced stories and technical documentation to share information with the engineering team. Typically this included details from API documentation supplied by our vendors or definitions for their custom data feeds. During Feature Kick-off meetings, I presented these new requirements to the team and solicited feedback to realise the complete solution based on their expertise.

This vision required us to reinvent our data collection and reporting capabilities to meet these needs. I became the Product Owner for the newly formed Vendor Integration Engine team. The team and I built the functionality necessary to meet the data collection requirements and scale to support a worldwide media agency group. I collaborated with external providers to create custom data feeds or utilised public APIs to retrieve the desired datasets. Once the integrations became possible, we refined the details as “three-amigos” before formally kicking off the development. We built a scaled platform that collected data from thousands of data sources to support hundreds of customers globally.</p>
<p>Pre-acquisition, I worked in the same capacity but regularly moved between initiatives to enhance data management and industrialise error-prone manual activities. To that end, I worked on greenfield projects covering the following topics:</p>
<ol>
<li>Creative Management for bulk uploading advertisements into multiple AdTech systems simultaneously.</li>
<li>Campaign Management for media planning and automation tool to create advertising campaigns across several AdTech platforms to speed up everyday setup tasks.</li>
<li>Inventory Management R&#x26;D to build a prototype for blocking websites with non-brand-safe content.</li>
