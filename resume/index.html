<p>Over the last two years I’ve mapped out our Product Vision, identify key product Personas for our customer groups, contributed to the tiering of functionality for our pricing strategy and defined our product management processes.

The team and I built the functionality necessary to meet the data collection requirements and scale to support a worldwide media agency group. I collaborated with external providers to create custom data feeds or utilised public APIs to retrieve the desired datasets. Once the integrations became possible, we refined the details as “three-amigos” before formally kicking off the development.

<p>Pre-acquisition, I worked in the same capacity but regularly moved between initiatives to enhance data management and industrialise error-prone manual activities. I collaborated with development teams on greenfield projects covering the following topics:</p>
<ol>
<li>Creative Management. To bulk upload advertisements into multiple AdTech systems simultaneously.</li>
<li>Campaign Management. It was a media planning and automation tool to create advertising campaigns across several AdTech platforms to speed up everyday setup tasks.</li>
