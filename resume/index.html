<p>As the Technical Product Lead, I am responsible for our Product Management processes and Ignite. I work with our CTO, Cofounders, SaaS Customers and Client Services team to consolidate our business strategy and user feedback to shape our product strategy and roadmap. Our processes allow me to prioritise outcomes for our customers. I then work through these themes with UX, Engineering and Quality Assurance colleges to realise a suitable solution.

<p>Ignite provides its users with a consolidated view of their sales revenue from Amazon, Rakuten, Shopify, Takealot, Walmart &#x26; WooCommerce sites. Additionally, our platform can consolidate media investments for display, search and social via Amazon, Facebook, Google and TikTok.

<li>Vendor Integration Engine, a highly scaled data collection engine.</li>
<li>Data Lake, for conforming event-level advertising data required by our data warehouse.</li>
<li>Entity Store, for normalising campaign setup metadata used by dashboards.</li>

<p>At the time, our system typically processed seven to ten terabytes of new data daily. To do so, we utilised AWS EC2, S3, EMR and Elasticsearch. In addition, there was a small React web app to administer the application and Grafana dashboards for monitoring.</p>
<p>I produced stories and technical documentation to share information with the engineering team. Typically this included details from API documentation supplied by our vendors or definitions for their custom data feeds.

I collaborated with external providers to create custom data feeds or utilised public APIs to retrieve the desired datasets. Once the integrations became possible, we refined the details as “three-amigos” before formally kicking off the development.

<p>Pre-acquisition, I worked in the same capacity but regularly moved between initiatives to enhance data management and industrialise error-prone manual activities. To that end, I worked on greenfield projects covering the following topics:</p>
<ol>
<li>Creative Management for bulk uploading advertisements into multiple AdTech systems simultaneously.</li>
<li>Campaign Management for media planning and automation tool to create advertising campaigns across several AdTech platforms to speed up everyday setup tasks.</li>
<li>Inventory Management R&#x26;D to build a prototype for blocking websites with non-brand-safe content.</li>

<p>To that end, I spent much of my time on investigative work to identify poorer content. I largely achieved this by using Data Science tools for Natural Language Processing and reviewing website traffic. The goal was to detect and modify over-optimised content pages or unsatisfactory content. The results of this ongoing analysis highlighted poorly structured pages requiring revision by Content Managers and poorer user experiences. We tackled these pragmatically and reinvented the product over several design sprints.</p>

We achieved this by reviewing popular searches classified as questions and outsourcing the creation of appropriate answers to publish new Q&#x26;A content and monetising them with Google Ads.
